        <div id="chapter 1">
            December 2,2026<br><br> It was a fine morning, stepping out from my bed I noticed that Shyla was up. As usual the same as every weekend but something really seems not to be alright. <br><br> I can feel it in my blood but there's nothing to
            worry about that's what I keep telling myself. Having finished my daily routine began to think what my life would had been if my Shyla was not with me.
            <br><br>Even the thought of Shyla not being with me makes me dragged to a state of utter loneliness. Then a sudden shutter sound from the door and here she comes the love of my life. Spanning towards me with a hug. But deep inside me feels
            like something's not alright. Then she goes to the kitchen to fulfill her thirst.
            <br><br><i>She seems to be obfuscated a little.</i>
            <br><br>Then all of a sudden she collapse. I thrived towards her and then she says "Darling you are the best thing that have ever happened to me, and I always loved you and admired you the most. But everything comes to an end at some point
            of time, well I guess here's my time now darling."
            <br><br>Taking a deep breath viciously she said -"I discovered that I had pancreatic cancer and I have got only a few more minutes left with me."
            <br><br>Not knowing what pancreatic cancer is and nescient of what to be done, I said -"Baby what are you talking about? Why you got only a few more minutes left."
            <br><br> She held her hand around my neck uttered with a despondent downhearted voice - "Darling I am gonna die in a few more minutes and there's something that I need to convey you."

            <br><br>I almost lost my mind and began to cry in agony poundering my heartful emotions and I hugged her whispering in her ears -"Baby no you can’t do this to me and stop saying that." <br><br> "All you need to know is on my laptop and after
            I depart from you please follow what I have been secretly developing for the past few days." <br><br> "Just follow as it is." <br><br> Then she gave me a deep kiss as if it was her last. And a mesmerizing look at me as if she is not gonna
            be with anymore. I was crying sorrowfully as if it was my last day with someone whom I really cared about.<br><br>
            <i>I feel like someone is forcefully extorting my wife far far away from me, where I can never even dream of visiting ever again</i>
            <br><br>Everything stated to fall apart within me.
            <br><br>Then came a silent tune from her lips -"Darling what type of wife am I to you" .
            <br><br>Out of emotions I cried to her -"You are a bad wife to me, you are saying you are gonna a leave me. I really shouldn't have fallen in love with you. You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met".<br><br> She gave a vivid smile
            saying "Darling just say me what type of wife am I to you."
            <br><br> I avowed saying her -"You are another mom to me darling. You are like my mom and treated and took care of me like your own son.”
            <br><br>Then she left with a loving smile at me. <br><br> Shyla thought me everything about hope, love and even she assimilated me to face life assiduously. <br><br>

        </div>
        <div id="chapter 2">
            April 2,2027<br><br> It’s been about 5 months for now Shyla leaving me in the state of utter darkness. Couldn't concentrate on anything but always have her last few words of her rolling in and out of my mind each and every time I inhale.<br><br>            Always she was my best girl that I ever imagined to have a life with. I questioned myself why am I still alive when I no longer can see my wife. <br><br> Thinking in and out for a few hours with a bottle of whisky in my hand and came to a
            final decision to get the hell out of this forsaken earth.
            <br><br><i>Fuck this shit!</i>
            <br><br>Being intoxicated above the limit and driving to a hill top mountain. I got out and started to trek.<br><i>This started to feel like shit already.</i><br><br> Then a sharp pointed piece of shit, strife my hand. "Fuck!" - I yelled.
            <br><br> "Maybe every love story ends this way" - I said to myself looking at the cloudy sky. I remember this place, me and my wife used to sit here all alone staring at the stars with naked eyes and holding each other out so that no ones
            gonna be frightened by vociferous sound of the wolves and the servile darkness.
            <br><br>"My pain is gonna come to an end, after all this happens no one gets hurt or have any emotions left behind"- I cried out in agony standing at the peak of the mountain edge. Shyla slapped me once when I told her that I will be taking
            a picture of glory standing on the edge of the cliff.
            <br><br>That was not the first time she slapped me, but she adjorned her feelings and cried dejectedly for hurting me - "Can you even imagine what might happen to me if something terrible happens to you."
            <br><br>"Can you? Huh! Can you….?"- she shouted at me, cuddling her arms with all the strength in her so that I wouldn't do something crazy.
            <br><br>But for now there's nothing holding me back right now. I guess god likes to see this kind of stuff happen so that he can have a good vociferous view of the scenario from above. The clouds started to cry just like me. Staring at the
            view I wished if my dearest wife was still alive. <br><br> Suddenly some of the stuff of me and Shyla was seen just below the edge of the mountain. Since this being my last day my conscience hunched me to take a quick look at it. Got down
            from the death spot where Shyla never wanted to go. <br><br> Taking a look at the stuff, I picked it up and it was Shyla's half torn picture. The rain was so heavy and it relentlessly pulled it off from my hand. I threw the bottle and began
            following the heavy cold breeze. The picture flew till the back of the mountain and got struck on one of the branches.
            <br><br>I tried to look around me to have the picture back again. But something struck my eye which wasn't supposed to be in this kind of place. Taking a closer look again I walked through. And this happened.
            <br><br>Began to think was it my wife who has been secretly doing this stuff without me noticing her. The cave had all the pictures of me and Shyla being together and childhood pictures of me and her. It felt like I was again with Shyla kissing
            her passionately.
            <br><br>I shouted -"Shyla please come back baby you can't do this to me please!"
            <br><br>The cave was like a canvas of me and Shyla during those moments which are worthy enough to remember again.
            <br><br>I touched each and every picture of her. There was this message which was glowing in the dark saying-"I knew you would definitely come here after my death, and I am really sorry darling since I can't be with you."
            <br><br>"Maybe I might not be the perfect wife for you as you dreamed of being with forever. But you are the one who I always admired as a perfect husband to be with, and as for now no wife would like to see her beloved husband salvage unhappiness."
            <br><br>"Darling I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now. But remember what your wife always tells you? Enlighten up little boy!<br>I am with you every time,<br>What for you crying about?<br>You got me."
            <br><br>She has been planning this a long time ago. The only person I hate the most is my wife. She kept a lot of secrets from me.
            <br><br>The message continues -"Darling always remember that everything happens for a reason maybe you and me not being together is for a bigger glut of new life." <br><br> "Take care darling I love you more than anything in this world. If
            you feel lonely think about the happy moments we spent together and drive away the sadness in you"<br><br> "Bye darling, I know it’s hard for you to say goodbye's".
            <br><br>The end of the message was signed by my wife - "Yours Shyla."
            <br><br>My phone started to vibrate vigorously when I make a glance at it displays a message automatically alerting -"Follow the instructions as mentioned in this application."
            <br><br>Then I started to realize that my wife has insisted me to look at her application that was stored in her computer.
            <br><br>Outrunning the strong breeze of rain and cold winds that flew over my face as if they were saying me to slow down a bit.
            <br><br>Ignoring the present world, I was running like a maniac to reach my home as fast as possible.
            <br><br>Smashing the door open quickly pressing the power button of her computer an application ran on startup and it says -"If you are reading this then I am either dead or I have been caught hardheadedly. I hope the second one is untrue."
            <br><br> Then the application takes me to a pre-recorded video of her .... <br><br> “Hi my sweetest hubby, I know it’s hard for you to see this. But I made all my efforts to make you happy. And I hope that I did. Baby, promise me that you
            will give life a second chance …” – she begged me. <br><br>


        </div>
        <div id="chapter 3">
            Clicking on the next button on the application my phone had been automatically wired to it and the mobile application my wife, who has been developing secretly for the last few months is installed on my phone.<br><br> And there were some beep
            sounds hovering around the computer all of a sudden and the computer started to opened up a terminal, and started to execute some bash scripts.
            <br><br>To my knowledge all the files were financial statements of my wife's wealth. And I immediately got a mail saying "The money is wired to your account" from one of the bank.
            <br><br>Nothing makes sense at all, ever since the day she left me. Everything doesn't seems to be normal the way they are. At first she saved my life and now she wired a whole sum of money to my account. I started to wonder what was she up
            to? Why she wired a whole lot of money? Why she saved me from committing a suicide?
            <br><br>At present I am in a egocentric situation where only maniacs like me would like to be.
            <br><br>Then again my phone vibrates with a alert message - "There are some things which we can't take care, just because of the reason I am not there with you. Doesn't actually mean that it's your fault. You took care of me when everyone
            whom I thought were my family neglected. And I feel it obdurately that you were my lucky star. Take care, Bye!" <br><br>
            <i>Then I started to agonize my pain out by flipping everyone out, who thought that they were a good to their life partners. <br>Who were remarked to be perfect husbands by their wife's. But actually they are not even worth it.</i>
            <br><br>I came to a statement -"How many of you really love those persons who has been with you during your hardest times and always supported you whoever you were in congruently of your current bill statements or any other stuff like that."
            <br><br>"And how you even repay your beloved ones? Have you ever felt a need to care for their perseverance? How often do you spend time with them actually? Did you guys out their cared for their small dreams that they are dying to have with
            you?"
            <br><br>"Do you guys out there really aware of what she really wanted from you? How often do you spend those momentous evenings with her enjoying coffee together in a same blanket or a single sweater. <br> None of them barely know the answers
            to these questions. What woman wants?"
            <br><br>As to my love with Shyla I can say that -"Woman needs financially security but apart from that they wanted their man to hear about their issues of their day and some hermetic affection showering on them at least.”
            <br><br>Because as of to my knowledge men and woman are from two different world we got a treat each other differently at inappropriate times of both sexes.
            <br><br>This is what happens if you love anyone too much. You either die or end up in a state of being controlled by someone else. But Shyla always cared about my well being. She always insisted me to pursue my dreams. She believed in me more
            than anyone else in this world or maybe even the only person in this whole universe.
            <br><br>Whatever, maybe she knew that I would go through this kind of phase in my life. But she always had faith in me that somehow she can get me out of this and make me live a happy life again. She always used to say me- "Darling you are
            the best and you can be anyone that you can even imagine who you would be."
            <br><br>Phone vibrates again with a notification saying -"Happy birthday darling -- your beloved wife Shyla." <br><br> Seeing it part of my sadness embedded inside me flew away, some happy tears started to shed through my eyes. I bowed down
            the floor and started to cry like I lost something more valuable in my life. If my baby was around here with me now she would have given me a passionate surprise. <br><br> As of the before year as usual I forgot that it was my birthday and
            was working late night in the office since it being the end of the deadline to submit the project the very next day. I ignored my phone the whole day and was really late to home.
            <br><br>Even my very own wife works with me, helping with the business stuff. But that very day she didn't even showed up in the office, the sole reason being my very own birthday.
            <br><br>After getting into my car destined to reach my home I took a peep at my phone and there were like 30 missed calls and 20 messages. All of them were either saying "Where are you darling?" or "When you would show up in home?"
            <br><br>I drove to my home wondering what might have happened to her or what's the problem? Thrived out of my car with the car door wide open and ran towards the house door. All I can see is an empty house, as if some ghost just moved in.
            <br><br>The power was out and I could barely see the windows with curtains swirling wide open and moving with the flow of the wind. I was really scared of what might possibly happen to my baby. <br><br> "Shyla! Shyla! Where are you?" - I screamed
            with all the potential left in me. Well no response was there. I was really scared and took a weapon which was violent enough to knock the other person down. <br><br>
            <i>What if the other one was not be a person? Or what if It's some other kind of fucked up shit? What do I fucking do then?</i>
            <br><br>I started to take my steps accordingly and wisely. But I hope she didn't wanted me to harm anyone or possibly harm myself. I felt something in my back as if someone was trying to back stab me with a knife.
            <br><br> When I turned around I see her, my wife so beautiful enough for my eyes to look at. She was with a candle which she kept on the cake. <br><br> <i>Shit! it's my birthday</i>
            <br><br>Then she told me to blow the candle and I did it the way she insisted me to. Then in the utter darkness she took a slice of cake from it and made me have it. Then as of a opposite reaction I too made her have it too.
            <br><br>Then all of a sudden she kissed me in the lips. She held me tight so that I couldn't say no to it. Then all happened in the dark till I took it up to the bed. Then after a few hours the sky was still dark it was about 3 am in the morning.
            <br><br> She got out of the bed with her messed up hair. <br><br> "Baby you are standing there in your underwear, and that's my T-shirt which you are wearing right now. Baby would you mind please closing the bedroom door" - I said to her with
            a mesmerizingly passionate voice. <br><br> She replied to get ready. I was just out from sleep and it was about 3 am in the morning and I didn't want to get up so early in the morning regardless. And as of too I can't say no to my sweet darling.<br><br>            .................
            <br><br>After a couple of minutes she was in the standing next to a car with a decent dress. She yelled at me to get in the car. I quickly thrived to her and she said that she would like to drive. I gave her the keys acquiescently. Then she
            drove like a maniac around the streets.
            <br><br>I wasn't aware that my wife would ever drive like this even in my wildest dreams. Then again she gave a surprising like she did the earlier night.
            <br><br>She drove to a nearby village and it took like 2 hours to get there. She shouted at me -"Come fast, the sunrise is about to begin."<br>And she took me there till the cliff of the mountain. And we witnessed the magnanimous view of sunrise
            together. <br><br> And she kissed me again and whispered by bringing me close to her lips - "I love you darling. Lets come to this place each and every year to celebrate your birthday. I don't won’t you to forget this again."
            <br><br>Then it all makes sense to my now. She is trying to connect the dots somehow.
            <br><br>An another notification again with a picture of me and her at the top of the mountain. I quickly got out of the house and got in the car destined to the same place where we were before the same year.
            <br><br>Tears shed through my eyes till an extent that I could actually see the road doubled in vision. I had a myriad of views.
            <br><br>Couldn't stop the tears flowing around my face but this time I can taste the tears to be sweet ones. Well for now I taste the tears would sweet if we cry for a good cause or for a happy moment.
            <br><br>



        </div>
        <div id="chapter 4">
            <br><br><em>Having arrived at the  place I had some nostalgic feelings looking at it. <i>This place is something. The place is empty like it used to be always. This place is surrounding by forest and no one likes to come to freaky places like this.</i><br><br>
                    I quickly got out of the car and started to stroll around. </em>
            <br><br> Again my mind started to have myriad delusions maybe this might be due to the ecstasy drug which I took the day. Delusions were so intense that I wasn't able to hold up and stand on my feet. Again something seems to be undone. Something's
            not right.
            <br><br>
            <i> Am I loosing my mind? Am I in control? Am i being pulled by someone else's string just like those dolls in the puppet show?</i>
            <br><br> "Control is an illusion" - I guess that Mr. Robot cliche is true. <i>Isn't it?</i>
            <br><br> Well this happened again, there she is starting at me just the way she did when she first proposed me. Something struck my head. My conscience started to warn me to stay away from her. I thought it might be the ecstasy effect or the
            intense attachment with my wife or maybe even she had been thinking about me and wanted to see me in person.
            <br><br> Whatever the reason might be she is here and that's all that matters the most to me right now. The fact that she looks exactly in each and every way the day of the proposal. She wore an Indian Saree, a green one which was my favorite.
            <br><br> ................... That was the day when I just became a human with emotions and lots and lots of humane feelings. She insisted me to come to this very location. I had a quick talk with her saying no. She asked me in a very polite
            way, just the way woman do when they want certain things they want to be done by us. Well she never asked me anything like that before. So I decided to go.
            <br><br> She even notified me that she will not be moving out of here if I wont show up as early as possible.
            <br><br> Things were not within my hands. She had been waiting for me since the past two hours. She is one stubborn lady whom I ever knew. She quickly came to me and dragged me to the summit point of the mountain. Its the vantage point.
            <br><br> Then she gave a mesmerizing look deep into my eyes which just made me thought what's wrong with her?
            <br><br> Then she held her cold fingers onto my face proposing -"Darling I would like to make plans with you."
            <br><br> "I can imagine what would be like to be with a man whom I have always admired.To spend the boring Sunday's, to have some one escort me to places where I feel lonely, to have a upper hand for me in case if I fall sick."
            <br><br> "To have a shoulder to rest on, to share the same blanket staring at the sunrise during those blissful winters. To have everything I have imagined to have with a man I always pictured of."
            <br><br> "Darling I am proposing you.What do you say? Are you willing to make unwitting desirable plans with me too?"
            <br><br> Then I giggled her fingers and took a step back from her. I was clear enough and said- "Relationship? With a guy like me? Are you crazy?."
            <br><br> Then I paused for a moment and fabricated a nice response - "Shyla you know that I am not a person who you would like to be fall in love or stuff like that. I am not worth your time. You deserve a better person than me, who have womanly
            feeling for his girl.Do you get it?"
            <br><br> Then she was so sensitive which surely made her cry. She turned back and started to wipe her tears.

            <br><br>I questioned her - "OK let's get this straight, let me ask you one thing. In near future not so far what if I die and that leaves you in a situation where you end up in a cross road."
            <br><br> "What would you do that matters the most?"
            <br><br> She came up to me in a slow manner and gave me a slap in the cheek viciously. Then out of emotional anguish she cried -"Shut up just shut up you cold blooded moron. I came here to propose you and you are questioning me what would
            I do if you die. Is it appropriate to the situation right now?"
            <br><br> "OK let me tell you one thing straight, If I were ever to loose you. Then you can count on me, because I will be the one to die before the day you pass away."
            <br><br> "Because I can never see my darling depart in front of me" - crying hazardously down her knees putting her hands down on the ground.
            <br><br> Well something changed me. Not just something everything I guess. All the perceptions I have been making up about woman, love and marriage all vanished just like that. I guess her feelings for me were so intense like the burning sun.
            I make her stood up even though she was still crying <span id="yui_3_17_2_5_1511837088265_2008" class="ya-q-full-text">as if the entire world, and all of its beauty, had come to an end. She sobbed as if she were a mere child who's lost in a urbane place."</span>
            <br><br> Well it's really hard to describe more of the situation. Seeing her cry made me pathetic for her and it made me cry too.
            <br><br> It's the time wiping her tears, making her look into my eyes I avowed -"Maybe I may not be the man who you were looking for. Maybe I might not be good at sharing a blanket with you, or maybe I might be bad at escorting you to places
            which I can barely pronounce. Maybe I might be worst at babysitting you while you feel sick."
            <br><br> "But what if? I can really try to be the man you always imagined to. Baby I can try and I promise you in front of this sun dust that I will never let you down. Whatever maybe the person you were or will be, I vow you that I will always
            be with you. And I love you."
            <br><br> She still sobered like a child who lost her favorite doll and wondering where to find it. But this time it was she being deemed with my words. She hugged me and said -"let's get married right now and right here."
            <br><br> I was astonished and told her lets do it. There was a small indian temple down the village not this too far. And we reached there as early as possible. There was just one man in the temple who devotes the god willingly in a sacred
            way. We told him we were about to get married. He got what we were upto. He made necessary arrangements to make it meritorious for the rest of our life's.
            <br><br> He then gave me a scared thread which he we call it as "Mangal Sutra" in our indian tradition. He directed me to tie three nods in the neck of the bride. My hands were shaking a bit. Shyla held her hands on me to abate the tension
            which was swirling through my hands. I tied exactly three nods. And the devotee gave me a sacred color which he pronounced it as "Kumkuma".
            <br><br> He mentioned me to swipe it gently on the forehead of the bride. Then after it's done he told us we were a couple now. Shyla insisted me to bend down and take the "ashirwaad" of the person who made this happen. We did it together.
            <br><br> Shyla had a spark in her eyes after the marriage. I guess every woman has it. We then spent the whole day together having a long walk through the woods and watching the sun set together as she liked it.
            <br><br> And spending the whole night watching the stars and talking about the future.
            <br><br> Now I am starring at this abandoned mountain all alone, even though this was not the exact same place. Even Shyla dissipated from my thoughts too. I can’t see her anymore now. Well I guess the power of "mangal sutra" was not enough
            to keep her safe.
            <br><br> I see the man who waved at me. I got up to him and he said diligently -"I know you would come here. Now please follow me."
            <br><br> With a lot of questions and answers that I am looking for. Don't know how this is gonna end.
            <br><br> But all I hope is for a better tomorrow and a long unfailing journey ahead.
            <br><br> She always used to say -"Life is worth living and you got a live an other day to witness it."
            <br><br>

        <div id="chapter 5">
            <br><br> Well before I go anymore further. There's something you guys need to know. It's about when all this started.
            <br><br>

            <b>May 30,2015</b>
            <br><br> Its the time where teenagers are to make tough decisions. Confusing people - Shattered Dreams - and acquiescently accepting the abstract decisions taken by elderly people. Well it's a phase of life where you gotta decide or someone
            else decides it for you pal.
            <br><br> Well I didn't know what to do or what I am about to do. Yeah but the thing what my father acknowledged me was - "Son I know you didn't found out yet the love of your life. Maybe you might be a slow boomer but I am confident in my
            son that in some point in life not so far you will discover yourself, your heart knows everything. You gotta listen to it son. It knows what to do."
            <br><br> "But for the point of time do what everybody does and when you realized that you found out what you have been looking for all these years. Just go for it."
            <br><br> He gave me a reasonable advice. That's what every father does when he finds out his offspring is in confused state. I took it deep inside me and hoped that at some point in life I might know what I have been actually looking for.
            <br><br> Long walks through the woods, staring at the vivid sunset and sunrise, early morning walks listening to the sounds of the birds chirping,and at the night pretending to be fearless hearing the wolves howl. Well this has been my daily
            routine.
            <br><br> Until she moved next door. The girl next door I guess. But not pretty much. There's one perception in me which obviated me to have any girlfriends or just friends.
            <br><br>

            <i>I hate girls they are no damn good.</i> Yes I am a misogamist not a misogynist hope so. Well for the fact I hated love, marriage and friendship with girls. I usually didn't have any girls as friends until now. Don't even like to have a
            casual talk with them. That's my perception.
            <br><br> When ever my parents go out for vacation or some usual kind of visit. I used to call up all my friends and used to have a gig. Bad habits that I have generally outruned my good habits. Serious drinking problem, but usually I have
            a drink whenever I feel like having it. But I ain't a pathological drinker or chronic or notoriously well known for being alcoholic.
            <br><br> The party has been going on with a lousy sound.
            <br><br> There's a knock knock on the door. The woofer sound was so intense that I could barely hear anyone's voice. Intoxicating myself to an extent that was not a permissible level for a 18 years old. I see everything doubled in size.
            <br><br> Someone other than my interest came inside my house. Not sure who it was but there's one damn thing which I always hated. A girl just came inside my house to abhor that the sound was too lousy. She accosted me and yelled -"Hey can
            you see what time is it right now? Are you out of your mind?"
            <br><br> In a fraction I adjoined her with a reply - "Well can you show me what time is it? The party is not gonna stop because the sound isn't as loud as you think it is."
            <br><br> Then a long pause I couldn't say anymore I passed out. Right onto the ground and I can see everybody in a slow moo. "Thud" - the sound which I felt after my head bashed to the floor.
            <br><br> Well it was the first time I met this new neighbor who just moved next door to my house. Pretty sure the first impression which I made in her didn't go well. But for the time being, i don't care what she thinks or what face she makes
            again if I ever happen to see her.
            <br><br> AFTER 7 hours:
            <br><br> Woke up in place which ain't my room or my home. The sun beam was right onto my eyes. I couldn't see properly. I fell off the bed. The door sound being opened, a girl in shots came upto me. Lying her soft hands onto me she questioned
            me -"Are you alright? Is everything okay?"
            <br><br> With a abortive effort I got up. Yeah even she helped me out to get up. Quickly I went to the washroom and splashed some water onto my <span class="oneClick-link oneClick-available">somniferous</span> face. Waited for a few minutes
            in starring myself in the mirror. Then I got out of the room where she made me stay the night. After not getting what's happening she tittered - "Hey what's wrong, did I say something wrong?"
            <br><br> Not even caring to stare at her, I got myself out of the house without no one escorting me back to my home like a sick patient who just got well. Well I even didn't thank her for taking care of me.
            <br><br>

            <i> This is the way I grew up. And I can't help this out.</i>
            <br><br> The night quickly rose up, I was up in the terrace doing my usual shit. I sat on the cliff with my headphones doing some Mr robot stuff. Not the stuff you think , but I was learning to code and some kind of computer thing. Then she
            showed up in her terrace. I pretended of not noticing her being there. Then she was trying to protest something. I didn't care to have a glance at her childlike behavior.
            <br><br> A sting on my back. I looked around and she's there looking at me. I took my headphones out of my ears. She mutters - "Don't you think you got a safer place then this to work on your laptop?"
            <br><br> I muttered back saying in irritation -"Do you mind? And if you do then please start minding your own business. Is it you always like to have a small talk or something?"
            <br><br> She made a abhor face towards me and yelled back - "What the hell? Did you just got out from jail. Or is it that you were caught drinking alcohol by your parents?"
            <br><br>

            <i>Did she just say a word involving 'parents'.</i>
            <br><br> I was frustrated as she involved my parents in this. The evil came out of me and uttered words which were not meant to said to girls - "Yeah I was caught drinking its fine. But you lady over there was caught masturbating by your father."
            <br><br> The gap between two houses was small enough to jump in. She hoped into my terrace and she jumped onto me. I was on the floor. She held her fingers onto my neck. I was almost chocking.
            <br><br> "You know what I should apologize myself for helping out a person like you. You got no feelings or care what others think about you" - she articulated her anger in wretched voice.
            <br><br> Then I rolled above her with a reversal, which I learned by watching WWE. She gave me a abyssal look onto me. I was stoned. Suddenly my dad shows up and intervenes us. My dad intervened our personal anguish.
            <br><br> I couldn't do anything. I felt mischief for myself for hurting a girls feelings. Her eyes were almost trembling. She was about to cry.
            <br><br> My dad helped her out and escorted her to the living room. I trailed back of my father after a short time. My dad made her sit in the couch and gave her a glass of water. My mom snuggled around her, since she was crying like a baby.
            Then after looking back at her I realized what a dreadful thing I have done to her. <br> My dad was angry at me as I can see it in his eyes and the face that he made. But he didn't utter a word. He was quite. I hated this silence. My mom escorted
            her back to her house.
            <br><br> Next day was after getting out of the bed. My day was bummed out at me.
            <br><br>

            <i>I feel guilty for myself for hurting a girl who took care of me while my parents were out. Now the question is, what to do make to me feel innocent?</i><br><br>


        </div>
        <div id="chapter 6">
            <b><i>So that happened huh! What a kind of guy are you? Whatever might be your perspectives or your thoughts, but never hurt a girl.</i></b> - My father says that often.
            <br><br> Looking myself in the mirror. The inside me started to talk to me. Sometimes I behave as a different person. The inside me came out and sat on the beanbag which I. "Do you feel guilty dude?" - inside me said with a malevolent voice.
            <br><br> I backfired upon him by replying -"Fuck off you twinkle douche, you ain't even real. You just a inner me. And for the record I don't feel guilty."
            <br><br> "I didn't commit any murder or involved in a sexual assault with her.I ain't feeling guilty."
            <br><br>

            <i>"Well lets find out who is gonna be held as a priority suspect by her father dude"</i> - inner me uttered. "Don't try to allege me. You are the one who showed your manliness up there yesterday"- I alleged him.
            <br><br>

            <i>"Look friend the issue now is you can't convince her father by accusing me, because you know the fact that I don't even exist in reality. I am just your thoughts dude"</i> - the inner me acknowledged me with the facts.
            <br><br>

            <i>"Well its time for me now to go. See yaa around dude."</i> - the inner me vanished.
            <br><br> Fuck what he just uttered was real. What the fuck am I supposed to do if her father wages a war against me. Not war literally. What am I supposed to say if her father comes home to confront me in front of my mom and dad. I was panting
            thinking about the circumstance, which I made it happen. Taking a deep breath I said to myself -"Lets face it".
            <br><br> ................................................................................

            <br><br> Taking a quick shower to chill up my head. Well its weekend, and I cant see any signs of her father showing up in my home or there weren't any sound of my father calling me downstairs. "The situation doesn't seems to messed up like
            I imagined it would be."
            <br><br> I sneaked out of the house, without my father conscience ever noticing me. Decided to take a long walk through the sundust. The particles of sundust strolling through my face felt so damn good. Just kept strolling the clean road.
            It's almost afternoon, the sun was burning smokes. People didn't wanna get fried outside. Many preferred to stay at homes during the afternoon's.
            <br><br>

            <i>Fuck! Here's she again just a few steps ahead of me.</i>
            <br><br> I couldn't make a nice face to her after all those mess which happened last night. I wanna query her whether she conveyed anything to her father about me. No I can't talk because that's who I am. I can't change my perspectives for
            a girl next door.
            <br><br> "Wouuh Woouh" -the dogs started to bark seeing a new girl in the hood. They surrounded her literally. She had no idea what she's supposed to do.
            <br><br>

            <i>Should I help her or not.</i>
            <br><br> She started to cry a river after seeing those ferocious dogs howling at her. Then I made an eye contact with her. I can see a innocent little girls eyes which I never noticed in any of the girls whom I ever saw.
            <br><br> "Scream as loud as you can and keep some kind of a shield infront of you" - directed her to do so. She screamed like hell and even hit one of the dogs with her bag.
            <br><br> She saved herself by believing in my words. She didn't confront me about the mess of last night. She came upto me and thanked me.
            <br><br> "Thank you! Kumar" - she said in a sweet voice for saving her day. <i> How the hell does she knows my name is kumar. We didn't have a friendly introduction like everyone has to. </i>
            <br> "Have you been involved in a assault with any dogs like this before?" -she questioned me with her curious look.
            <br><br> "Every time, when I jump in to an abandoned place to enjoy it's artistic beauty" - I replied.
            <br><br> "So you are a nature guy, haa?"- she questioned me as if she were my best friend.
            <br><br> "Well I guess so? OK we are done her and I got to leave" - I tried to put down the conversation as soon as possible. She might be thinking what kind of guy refuses to have a conversation with a girl like her.
            <br><br>

            <i>"Dude what the fuck are you doing with her?Are you trying to make out with her or hang around like every other douche does?"</i> - the inner me questioned me.
            <br><br> I tried not to look at the inner me as she might think that I was retarded or some kind of obscure guy. "Where you heading to?"
            <br><br> "Well it depends" - I backfired her.
            <br><br> "Do you mind if I join you?" - she requested me in a polite way. I couldn't say no though.
            <br><br> ...................................................................
            <br><br> "I am glad that you let me walk with you" - she breached the silence between us.
            <br><br> "I heard that you don't like to hang with girls and something like that. Well you may have your own reasons but atleast try to give them some respect and try to think from their perspectives" - she said adroitly.
            <br><br>

            <i>No girl accosted me like this ever before.</i> "I don't abhor girls or girl's feelings. And who told you that I hate girls anyways. Whomever it might be they are trying to allege me that's it"- I bluffed whatever came up in my mind since
            I was just making up to nullify her words.
            <br><br> "Oh yeah! Then face the fact, your mom told me everything about you, literally everything. And what makes you think she got a lie about her beloved son to a new neighbor next door" - she confronted me with the truth.
            <br><br> "Are we done talking shit?"- I asked with a vicious look.
            <br><br> "Look I don't want this shit in my life. And yes I abhor girls a lot. I hate those especially who boost themselves as Mrs.Nice looking. Look I don't need to explain you, and what are you gonna achieve changing my perspectives" - I
            literally made a bad dispute with her.
            <br><br> "I thought I saw something good in you when you helped me figure out with that dogs thing. You are trying to be a bad guy, but the fact is there is something deep inside you which is beautiful then you think it would be" - she said
            with a melancholy look. <br><br>


            <i>"Dude she is messing up with your head.Get the fuck out of here.Remember what you vowed me."</i> - the inner me quickly intruded.
            <br><br> Listening to my reflection I tried to leave. But it was almost dark, were it's not safe to leave a girl alone. I walked slowly a few feet from her. But I felt guilty.
            <br><br>

            <i>What if something happens if I leave her alone hoping she would come home safe without my presence. If something happens, I would feel more guilty then her father does.</i>
            <br><br> Making a decision I called out for her. "Hey we cool right? This place is not safe for a women during night time. The thing you got to acknowledge is do you mind if I trail back of you till we get home." - I requested her in a polite
            way.
            <br><br> Taking a look around she said -"OK, but please don't trail around me walk with me because I feel terrified."
            <br><br> I winked at her. She was funny that way. We stared to walk the same way around hoping that dogs wont wage a war against us. There were no street lights,thought it might be a power cut. She started to walk really close to my permissible
            levels.
            <br><br>
            <i>Why come girls have all the fun. Are men a source where women can do whatever they want and however they want. Shit! I should say her to stay away from my shoulders. That would make her think if I am gay. No I can't let thoughts like those hover around her brain.</i>
            <br><br>

            <b>Thud! Thud!</b> a sound from nowhere. Just like those climax scenes in those horror movies. "I guess the time has come for us to witness one of those spectacular moment" - I maligned her with daunting words.
            <br><br> "Witness what I need to go home"- she said it in a panting voice.
            <br><br> "The thing is you were almost lost. You should have never have come with me." She was terrified with my suspense. "Take a look around we are literally standing on the grave yard and you are about to step on a freshly dig grave where
            someone is gonna aquoit it." - I made her see the reality.
            <br><br> Looking at the deep dip she screamed like an airplane jet screamed over the town. She sprang onto me. Cuddling around me like a small baby out of fear. That's the first time I was ever been cuddled by a girl of my age. Something felt
            different at that moment.
            <br><br> I made her step back and said sorry for everything that I had done mischievously.
            <br><br> I pointed her the way back home. She ran out with flying fears. After few hours I sneaked into my room and ate some spinach. Then I looked out onto the window. There I see her staring at me. Her room is aligned perfectly next to mine.
            I can see deep inside her eyes which wants to talk to me.
            <br><br> I ignored her. And got to bed without even gesticulating goodnight to my new neighbor next block.
            <br><br> An arbitary sound of window being opened by itself or if someone is opening it with their hands.I could hear the sounds so perfect that i started to panic.I could feel things around me subconsciously. I rose up and I was really panting
            taking vicious deep breaths.
            <br><br> I pleased myself that it might just be a bad dream. But things don't go as we expect them to. I can see someone standing in my balcony with long hair.Huuuuuuuuuuuuh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
            <br><br>


        </div>
        <div id="chapter 7">
            "Who the fuck is that over there trying to scare the shit out of me. Bitch? - I yelled.<br><br> Then she slowly walks out to me. Her hair was in a flow with the breeze of the wind. Then as she walks into the light, I can see only her face
            and her dress was articulated with the darkness.     <i>Shit it's none other than the new girl in the neighborhood. This time she came up with something in her head.</i>
            <br><br> "Damn is that you? What the heck are you doing in here? How the fuck did you manage yourself to get in here?" - I interrogated her by questioning her in all possible ways.<br> "Is it how you treat a girl who shows up in your room?"
            - she backfired me with a maleficent look. Her eyes were widened enough to scare the shit out of me.
            <br><br> "What kind of girl or woman shows up in my room this late night other than my mom who sneaks in my room to check if her son is at home?" - i replied her gazing at her widened eyes.A long pause and she gazed at me too malificiently.<br>            It was just like we were confronting each other with a gang bang in our imagination."Did you just call me a bitch or slut?" - she queried me with a angry face. Didn't know what to answer but i am sure that she was here for something.
            <br><br> "Yes indeed.But here's the fuckin reason I thought you were a ghost who came to posses me and do the shit what ghosts usually do." - I made a informative statement to let her know that she was the culprit.<br> "You made me walk through
            the graveyard unconsciously, but when you feel a presence of ghost in your very own room you get terrified and flip her off with swear words" - she questioned me in a daunting way.
            <br><br> She is mad at me for making her walk through the graveyard, that's the reason why she showed up in my room with a ghost attire.<br> "Look I am sorry for what I have done yesterday and today. Let's just forget about those things and
            move over it, OK! "
            <br><br> "Lets pretend like this shit never happened between us. Maybe like you don't know me or i never met you.Just like that. See it's that simple" - i told her to make sure that she fades away all those things which happened between us.
            <br><br> "Yeah i guess it's better to do that" - she said in a soft voice with a mix of sad and terrifying face.
            <br><br> She started to move out of the house the same way she got in.She wasn't able to hold the ceiling of the balcony to get down from the cliff."Do you mind if i escort you out of my house? - i requested her after seeing her abortive effort's
            to get down.
            <br><br> "Wouldn't that alert your parent's?" - she replied.
            <br><br> "Look who is here, the expert in sneaking out with ease. I can manage things like these and you don't gotta worry about that" - i said in a proud way which i am good at.We slowly got down the steps and i told her to remove her shoes
            to sneak so that we could sneak out without alerting my parents.I opened the main door with ease and obviating the sound while opening the door. The street lights were still on.
            <br><br> Holding her shoes in hands she bluffed -"I iiii". A long pause, she was dragging the char 'i'.<br> "You know I came to say thank you for taking me to the beach and saving me from dogs" - she thanked me hearfully.
            <br><br> "It's OK,so goodnight i guess" - i bluffed not knowing what to say."You guess,do you got any plans late night?" - she questioned me.<br> "Just thinking of taking a long walk, and lying down and staring at the moon for some time" -
            i shrugged."It's gonna be cool right" - she interrupted me and continued "You are one such insane guy i have ever met".
            <br><br>
            <i>Is she praising me or is she daunting me as a psychopath.What the fuck is happening.Should i backfire her or just let her go.Shit! I hope the inside me comes into action</i>
            <br><br> "OK I guess? I would just have a normal sleep like I usually do" - she said in a disparaging herself.
            <br><br>
            <i>Is she feeling low that I am gonna take a walk since I am a guy? And more secure than girls? Is she sad that she can't do things like I do?</i><br>
            <i>Somethings feels off tonight. But whatever, why the heck am I thinking from her perspectives. I feel like shit right now.</i>
            <br><br> "Hey do you mind to come with a dangerous guy like me? Right now?" - I asked her.<br> "Well I only feel insecure when I am with guys who try to pretend like Mr. Good guys, but not with some boy who pretends just the way he is" - came
            the reply from her with a smilie face. Her lips were mesmerizing, the way she smile was different than any other girl who fakes it everytime.
            <br><br> Started to take a walk from our houses. We kept two feet distance between us, since I hated to walk together or maybe that's the way she wants it too.
            <br><br> The street lights were still on with certain delay in color switching. This is one of my favorite place. I stood still in front of the traffic lights. Got on my knees and quickly lied down on the middle of the road.
            <br><br> "Hey what are you doing?" - she questioned me with a smile lit on her face. "Nothing, I just like to watch the blend of the traffic lights with the moonlight" - I said.<br> "Cool! But for now please get up, since there's a truck on
            the way" - she informed me sporting the truck. I got up , she gave me a hand quickly.
            <br><br> We just kept on walking for almost 20 minutes and it was almost 2:30 in the morning. "Do you like to take long walks too?" - I asked her politely.
            <br><br> "Yeah, I used to have some, before my parents death" - she said.<br>
            <i>She a orphan, how come I didn't know that? I made a huge mistake by hurting her feelings.</i>
            <br><br> "What, don't you live with some old guy and a lady? - I questioned her with curiosity. "They are not my parents, they are just couples whom I came to stay with and pursue my studies in here" - she said with the smile on her face still
            on.
            <br> "I am really sorry for your loss. And please pardon me if I was mean to you" - I apologized her.
            <br><br> "Hey it's OK. I lost my parents when I was like 8" - she said like she got used to it after all these years. "I feel like I am with my parent, when I am hanging with you. You kinda remind me of those nostalgic feelings about my parents"
            - she continued.
            <br><br>
            <i>Shit I am a bad guy who hurt a girl, who feels lonely everyday. May god absolve me for my sins.</i>
            <br><br> "Hi my name is Kumar, and I am desperately looking for some cool friend irrespective of the gender for some cool summer adventure. Are you interested madam? And can you please tell you name and formally shake hands with me to accept
            me as a friend" - I quickly broke the ice that was between us that I kept stupidly.
            <br><br> "Well let's find out if it's gonna be cool or not. My name is Shyla McGrewar Hills and I am considering your request for the plans you made during these summer holidays" - she said with joie de vivre. (french word for extensive happiness)
            <br><br>
            <i>I feel happy after all these years. Why am I felling happy? Is it she or the friendship we just made. Whatever she feels enlightened now. </i>
            <br><br> We started walking together now with just 1 inch distance between us, not like the way before the small talk.
            <br><br> There comes the cursed house. She felt terrified as I can tell the way when she cuddles back of me. <i> She's scared I guess. Maybe really scared. </i>
            <br><br>
            <i>What if she knows that I am planing to circumspect the house from inside. </i>
            <br><br>
            <hr />

        <div id="chapter 8">
            There's this cursed house which I am standing in front of. Lots of stories, rumors and buzzer's which I had heard from many people around. Many warned me not to go near the house vicinity.<br><br> Usually people who dared to take a look around
            inside the house or the people who were curious enough to solve this mystery which had been held for so long.
            <br><br>

            <em>These people have either died of snake bite or have got sick and died slowly. Which nobody wants.</em>
            <br><br> She was nescient about the cursed house which we were staring at. She insisted me to walk a little faster. Maybe she got frightened having a mere glance at the rotten house.<br>
            <em>I can't risk her anymore. Maybe I can just step into the house and have quick look around the house from inside.</em>
            <br><br> Whatever I made up my mind to circumspect the house and feel the presence of any unearthly matter which might be present inside the house.
            <br><br> If something goes wrong, only one thing's gonna happen - I might be alleviated by the ghost or witch or whomever present inside the ambiance of the house.
            <br> I wanted her to stay here acquiescently outside the house while I hop in.
            <br><br> "Can you do one thing without asking why?" - I requested her staring at the vivid structure of the cursed house.<br> "Anything which doesn't involve you going inside this house" - she said.
            <br><br>

            <em>Is she reading my mind? How did she get to know I was planning to get inside. Maybe she is my alter ego. She is just like me. I hope? </em>
            <br><br>

            <em>I ain't acumen about all this ghost stuff or neither I ain't no tyro who is just getting started with this ghost stuff.</em>
            <br><br> "I want you to stay aloof in here, no matter what happens after I go inside. I don't wanna hurt you anymore by my stupendous acts. Just promise me" - I ordered her watching her cute eyes which were insisting me not to go.
            <br><br> "Are you a psychopath. Can't you understand what am I trying to say. This house right here is cursed, and anyone who tries to sneak in dies" - she demanded me not to leave with a demagoguery look at me.
            <br><br> "OK I am not gonna go, let's walk back to our homes" - I was equivocating the situation. While she was walking I outrunned her and sneaked into the house.
            <br><br> She was screaming which was loud enough to wake the unknown demon which might be present in this wicked house.<br> Couldn't see a fucking thing in this shitty house. You can't expect the door welcoming in this kind of house. So I
            sneaked in from the wrecked window just next the door. I quickly got my phone out and turned on the torch.
            <br><br> I have never even thought to sneak into a house like that. After a few steps the house was clearly visible. The moon light from the top made this happen. The staircase inside the house was rotten and there was a big portrait of a
            lady which exhorted me not to get any close.<br><br> The house was just like I have imagined. There was a statue inside the house which was carved in a gesticulation manner. I got very close to the statue and took a picture. I didn't care
            to look at the picture. I really wanted to go to the terrace of this house. Started to step on the rotten steps.
            <br><br> Someone’s behind me, I can feel the presence and even the ferocious breath of it.<br> I wasn't scared since I was expecting to witness these kinds of stuff. The demon behind me said viciously - "This is my house."
            <br><br> My heart started to pump faster after witnessing more what I thought. It said in a maleficent voice. <em>Let it do what it wants’ but I ain't leaving without taking a look at the terrace.</em><br><br> Something caught my sight. I
            quickly turned towards this disturbing thing which I wasn't expecting to see in this place. There was a cute little girl with a smile held in her face. I ran towards her.
            <br><br> She wasn't saying a word or she ain't even changing her cute little expressions. I bend down towards her.
            <br><br> "Hey what are you doing all alone in here? Are you lost?"- I questioned her. She was laconic. <em>Maybe she speaks out only for the appropriate question asked.</em><br> She pointed her index finger towards the lady in the picture.
            I looked back there was nothing unusual.
            <br><br> But something was not right. <em>Shit! The picture is alive. Something’s inside the picture.</em>
            <br><br> Just after a few seconds something started to run like a maniac towards me. It was fast enough if I were bashed by it? I would certainly blew away.
            <br><br> Well it did bashed me. I fell off towards the living room and my head had been bashed right onto the wooden floor. I was bleeding.

            <br><br> It jumped off the top to accost me for sneaking in without it's permission. My eye sight was vague and I couldn't see a thing. It started saying MY HOUSE. The sound was loud enough which made a tinning sound effect reverb in my ears.
            All of a sudden Shyla intervened and bent towards me. She held her hands towards my head to stop the bleeding.
            <br><br> And after she happened I passed out in her hands. That's all I remember. And slight of she cuddling her hands around me from the back in a moving road. And a slight of she escorting me to a hospital where the hospital staff was asking
            her to sign some documents.
            <br><br> What happened? What really happened was a mystery for me.<br><br>

        </div>
        <div id="chapter 9">
            "Nurse! Nurse! Please come here quickly, he is awake"<br>
            <br> I could barely see the place with my flickering eye lids. Everything was darned to me. Only thing that I could think of is what happened the other night when I was in a beleaguered abandoned house that no individual dare to sneak in.
            <br><br> My eyesight was blurred, all I can see is gradient colors. A pink vaporized color person comes towards me and checks my pulse.
            <br><br> "Doctor his blood pressure is dropping at a very fast rate"
            <br>"Immediately ameliorate his health condition, just the way that happened with the other patient we dealt with"
            <br><br>
            <em>Health condition what the fuck is happening? I am supposed to be normal. Where the fuck am I? What is this place?</em>
            <br><br>
            <em>"Dude calm down you are in a hospital, where you seems to be the patient that the doctor and nurse are talking about!"</em> - the inner me verbalized.<br> "Why weren't you there with me when I was circumspecting the house?" - I questioned
            my inner me.<br><br>
            <em>"Well I couldn't be because I am afraid of ghosts a bit"</em>
            <br><br> "OK, let's get this conversation straight? What happened to me the other night?" - I asked him out of curiosity as my health condition got exacerbated.
            <br><br>
            <em>"Dude I think the time has come for me to say goodbye. Someone else has taken my position, so I gotta abdicate from my position who takes care of you"</em>
            <br><br> "What the fuck happened to you? Did I get laid with the weird ghost which happened to be a lady. Was she hot? - I questioned strolling up the pillow with the support of my hands.
            <br><br> I can smell something unusual which I never smelt of. When I turned my head towards the left, I can see the blood staining my pillow. I never ever imagined that I would be in such a averse health condition.
            <br><br> Then the path of the blood started to weep through my shoulders and stated staining my shirt. I can feel the blood all over my body all of a sudden.
            <br><br> My eyesight retained back to normal. I can see my inner me with clear pristine vision. Then the doctor and the nurse came running towards me and pulled me a little and started to work on my head.
            <br><br> Something unusual is happening to my inner me. He stated to fade out slowly. Then when only some part of him is left Shyla swished over him and after that I couldn't see him anymore. Not even the fragments of him in any part of the
            room.
            <br><br>
            <em>Is he really gone forever? Does he really say his final goodbye's to me? What does he mean by someone is here to take care of me now?</em>
            <br><br> .............
            <br><br> "Doctor I got what you asked for"<br> Then the doctor started to inoculate the syringe through my skin. Black and white in my vision again.<br> Well literally I might be sedated by some legal drugs they gave me when I was in conscious.
            But I can feel everything around me and even the voice around me too. I can feel the touch of Shyla cuddling in my palms of my hands. I can feel her soft touch.<br> All of a sudden I can feel the drizzle of water in my hands. <em>Wait am I outside the hospital, but that cannot be possible.</em><br>            No way Shyla was shedding tears which literally have fallen right on my hands.
            <br><br> "Nurse is he gonna be alright?" - Shyla queried the doctor.<br> "He seems to be normal, but due to a strong blow on his head it may take some time to recover. But the good news is nothing's gone wrong"
            <br><br> "It's strange that his health condition is normal, even though he got hurt adversely." - the doctor replies to Shyla.
            <br><br> "See there is nothing to worry about. He is alright now, why don't you go home and inform his parents to switch?" - the doctor said.<br><br> "No doctor I can't leave him here alone. His parent's are not at home"<br> "And I can't reach
            them out right now or I even can’t call them up and worry them about this. Rather I would stay here and look after him" - Shyla said.
            <br> "Are you his wife or girlfriend? You seem to have a lot of concern about him than anyone else" - the doctor asks in a benign way to get to know about our relationship.
            <br> "He is just my friend doctor" - Shyla replies with a slight of smile sound which I figured out. "Hmmm! It seems that you are at a start. You will get to know after a while. Anyways just press the button in case you need anything" - the
            doctor said.
            <br><br> That conversation went well. What does the doctor thinks about us.
            <br><br> After a while it was almost late night, since I can say this after a slight of yawning sound from her. She laid down side to me. This is was the first time a girl slept besides me.
            <br><br> Well not literally slept though. She laid her hands around my waist and her lips close to my check. She relaxed her whole body without disturbing the medical system which the hospital staff employed for me.
            <br> I can feel her the fragment of her hair laying on my nose. It was ticklish. But what can I do. She was so close to me, but not too tight.
            <br><br> "You are gonna be alright darling." - she whispered.<br><br>
            <em>Did she just say darling?</em>
            <br><br> "I can't leave you like this and go home. There's one thing that I wanted to say you since yesterday before you sneaked into the house"<br> "Baby I love you, I can see both my parents in you which I never imagined that I could see
            in anyone else. I know that you are not conscious right now"
            <br> "Maybe after this you may not meet me or we may not be able to hang out like we did the other night. So I am condoning in a callow way"<br> "But here's the thing I love you it means that I truly meant 'I love you', it doesn't mean anything
            else, OK!" - she whispered.<br><br> She came forward a little to reach my checks and then she embraced me by smooching her soft lips on my check.
            <br><br> Well that night went in a capricious way where I never expected that Shyla would fall in love with me and propose me when I fell unconscious.
            <br><br> But the question still remains why did the inner me fade away, what really happened the other night which melted Shyla's heart to propose me.
            <br><br>
            <em>I am really out of my mind right now. Gotta get out of this hospital as soon as possible</em>

            <br><br>
        </div>
        <div id="chapter 10">
            <br>   "Excuse me sir you gotta wake up and hold back now"
            <br>"We have to take some of blood samples, so please hold your fist slightly" - the nurse requested me.
            <br>The nurse woke me up civilly the way they were trained to.
            <br><br> I noticed that Shyla was not next to me. I couldn't see her anywhere as I dragged back up the pillow for the blood samples the nurse asked for.
            <br><br>
            <em>Where is she? I should probably ask the nurse.</em>
            <br><br> "Nurse do you know where she is? I mean the one who joined me in here" - I asked in a fainting voice.
            <br>"You mean the one whom I woke up before getting to you?" - the nurse said.
            <br><br> "Yeah! Yeah! She is the one" - I said.<br> "Well the doctor cajoled her to go home and come back later, since she was here all night looking after you" - the nurse said.<br> "Ouch! It hurts" - I said in agony while the nurse was doing
            her blood sample business.<br> "It's obvious that it hurts. OK in case of anything you need just press the button to your left" - the nurse adjoined.
            <br><br> "Can I discharge today. I seem to be alright" - I questioned.
            <br>"Well you health condition seem to be normal then yesterday's, but the final decision is to be taken by our doctor" - the nurse said.
            <br><br>
            <em>Always hated these hospitals, well who in this world likes to be bedridden. Do you?</em>
            <br><br> The morning sun seems to be up already, I never woke up this late. I held my back on the pillow with the bed in a oblique way.    <br>                                    All I could think of is Shyla, her overwhelming affection that
            she had showering on me. I never received such kind of affection.<br><br>
            <em>I guess that's why people termed me as cold blooded.</em>
            <br><br> ...........................
            <br><br> "How you feeling boy?" - the Doctor asked in a refreshing way.
            <br>"Feeling almost okay enough to get out of here" - I said.
            <br>"Not so fast boy, you gotta slow down in life. Life is not gonna be fare, you gotta have a lot of patience" - the doctor verbalizes a cliché.
            <br>"Thanks but let's be concise, when I am gonna go out?" - I asked out since I can't hold back in this hostile place anymore.
            <br><br> "Maybe in two days or so, I hope or even a week if you act in a obscure way to get out" - the doctor was way too straightforward to me and said it on my face. <br>"Well I choose the former one I guess"- I said dubiously.
            <br><br> "That's better" - the doctor said in a benignant way. <em>He is complicating me to stick my ass here till he says so</em>
            <br><br> "Doctor do you know when she is gonna come back?"- I moaned as I can feel the pain in my forehead.
            <br>"Easy boy! Easy! She told me that she would be back in an hour or two. And she fastidiously requested me to take look after you in her absence" - the doctor stated.
            <br>"Oh!"<br> "Hey let me ask you something, are you both together or you both a happy couple?" - the doctor asked me with a grinning look at me.<br>
            <br> "She is just my friend doctor"
            <br>"But I can't see the friendship thing in you guys, boy. A friend would never cuddle up next to him/her and whisper those three little magical words"
            <br>"What are you talking about?"
            <br>"Boy I know what happened the other day. Don't you acknowledge the fact that I am a doctor"
            <br>"But how do you know that she proposed me?"
            <br>"Those three little magical words always have the same lip movement with the same expression's on the face, irrelevant of the situation"
            <br><br> "You seems to have a lot of experience in this thing"
            <br>"Yeah but never got an intense affection from my wife before our marriage, but I regret that I never had such a girl like you do. She stayed up all night looking after you, I never even saw something like that even in movies boy" - the
            doctor said.
            <br><br> I interrupted him - "Are you kidding me? I am not in love with her."
            <br>"Well boy mark my words you would never get such a girl in your life. Or let me say it the other way around you could never even imagine such a kind of girl even in your wildest dreams" - the doctor tried to acknowledged me.
            <br><br> "Oh! Thanks for the free advice" - I said in a malignant way.
            <br><br>
            <em>What's wrong with this old man. Why is he trying to malign me. Such a doushan.</em>
            <br><br> Almost 12:30 pm and I was starving. I pressed the button to my left and the nurse arrived. Asked her to get me some vegan food. She got it to me quickly and she placed it to my side table.
            <br><br> "Is there anything you want?" - the nurse questioned me. <em>Is it okay if I ask her to spoon feed me, it would be so mean to request her to spoon feed me like a toddle.</em>
            <br><br> "No? Thank you!" - I replied.
            <br><br> ................
            <br><br> Tried to grab the spoon with the collaboration of my little finger and my thumb finger. But the effort was abortive. The spoon slipped through my little finger and fell down. I tried to get my finger's figuring out to grab the spoon
            as I can't literally see where it has fallen.
            <br><br> Suddenly I can feel the touch of her again on my hands.<br> "What are you trying to grab so hard" - she asked with the cute face that she made.<br> "Huh? The spoon just slipped which was supposed to aid me have some food"- I said.<br>            "Well don't try so hard because I am here to help you by feeding you with my finger's" - she said.
            <br>I can see her sober deep inside her eyes.
            <br><br>
            <em>Maybe she is really in love with me, I guess that's what lover's do when they see their beloved one's in facing trouble.                                                   Maybe I should just remain ambivalent about the situation that happened last night. I hope that she doesn't know her secret proposal being heard by me subconsciously.</em>
            <br><br> She fed me the food with her soft fingers. My mom used to feed me like this when I was little. Now she does it.<br> "How are you feeling right now?" - she questioned me desperately.
            <br>She is feeling my pain, I can see the tears rupturing through her eyes. But she is holding them back. <em>What is she so sad about?</em>
            <br><br> "I am fine now, the doctor says that U can discharge in two or three days" - I said.<br> "Look I didn't want to call your parents because I didn't want to concern them" - she said.<br> "That's alright, I cannot see any liability here
            since I got a good friend like you looking after me" - I said with a delightful expression on my face. "We are more than just friends" - she stated.
            <br><br>
            <em>This thing between us is getting way too far. I gotta stop her or else she might start making plans already?</em>
            <br><br> "Cool, so what just happened in that crocked house. How did you get me out from that horrifying abstract thing?" - I asked her out of curiosity.
            <br><br> "I could tell you, but for that I have to kill you" - she said smirking her face out. <em>She looks at me in a very different way, that I never imagined to.</em>
            <br>"So you are not gonna tell me?" - I asked her.
            <br>"Just wait for the appropriate time to ask me" - she backfired me with a dubious face.<br><br> .............
            <br><br> After the meal she moped my lips. She got so closer towards me as if she deserved a kiss for what she did. I decided to remain aloof for what she's trying to do. She made a direct eye contact with mine which are conducing me to kiss
            her. But you know I am not that type of guy bluh bluh......
            <br><br> She didn't want to make a move after condoning herself with the hint she gave me through the eyes. But guess what she did make a move.
            <br><br> She put the tissue down and held one of her hands on mine and the other on my check and she landed her lips on mine. I was stoned not knowing what to do after all the things that she did for me. She kissed for more than three minutes.
            <br><br> Her kiss just kept getting stronger and stronger, and she was trying to abridge the gap between our bodies. I held my other hand on her back. She was almost so close to me that we were almost just one step further to getting laid.
            She flipped her lips more than two to experience the different angles with me. Then she kissed. smooched my neck and again got back her lips on mine. This time she was so violent, she was trying to have a deep kiss(French kiss) with me.
            <br><br> She did actually, just for a few seconds though until someone came by.
            <br><br> "Arghh Arghhh!" - a alarming sound.
            <br><br>
            <em>Shit it's the doctor, she caught us dichotomously.</em>
            <br><br> Shyla piled out of me and quickly walked out of the room. <em>Now the doctor sees me in a maleficent way</em>
            <br><br> "I heard from both of you that you were just friends, but what I see now doesn't characterize you as so" - the doctor said with a proud look on his face.
            <br><br> "I don't know all of a sudden she suddenly kissed me and I was stoned" - I said.
            <br>"But you didn't abnegate her after that right?" - the doctor questioned.
            <br><br> "I don't know what to say" - I said with confusing thoughts strolling around my head.
            <br><br> "You don't have to say anything, just go with her flow. Someday you would acknowledge my words" -  the doctor said.
            <br><br> His words made my thoughts still worse of not knowing what to do about her.
            <br><br>
            <em>So what you guys would have done? If you were in my position??</em><br><br>
        </div>
        <div id="chapter 11">
            Well that went unexpected, I never hoped that Shyla would fall in love with me. But the thing is either of us wanna acknowledge the fact that we need each other so badly. What makes a girl to fall in love with a guy like me. Yeah I mean a asshole like
            me, what persuaded her to be with me all night?
            <br> Is it true about a cliché that I heard "Every pretty girl fall for a fool."<br> Well I ain't no fool technically because I am a tyro programmer. I can't imagine breaking Shyla's heart all of a sudden by telling her to leave me alone.
            But I got to.<br><br> If this thing between us gets inclined, then it's gonna break Shyla's heart adversely. She deserves a better guy who treats her like a princess, not like a slave. She is the best person whom I have ever met or the only
            person whom I met.<br><br>

            <em>If I don't break things with Shyla now, then it's gonna be too late to regret before things get out of control. I can't see the only girl who loved me in a abysmal despair. She deserves a guy not an animal like me.</em>
            <br><br> My mom showed up in the hospital after two days. She came to me accost my health condition.<br> "How are you feeling now?" - my mom asked me.
            <br>"Better then never" - I said with a mocking look at my mom.
            <br>"Are you completely out of your mind, what persuaded you to sneak into that crocked house?"
            <br>"Mom....... just stop already, I am not in a mood to have this conversation right now. Just leave me alone for a while for god sake"
            <br>"Stop talking to me like you do with others, I am your mom. Remember? And you are still a kid from my perspective"
            <br>"Mom I am 18 already, I am not a kid anymore. I am an adult"
            <br>"Adults don't do childish act's like you did the other night sneaking out of the house without our notice"
            <br>"Mom please I am not in a mood to confront you about that house"
            <br>"OK? let's not talk about it, do you know that you father was sick all of a sudden. It's obvious to me that father and son are both bedridden"- my mom said.
            <br><br>
            <em>What my father is sick?</em>
            <br><br>"What about him?" - I said.
            <br>"He just got a severe headache and his stomach started to act strange. The doctor's sedated him too and they insisted to me to keep an eye on him. They tacitly told me not to go anywhere else leaving him."
            <br>"Shyla approached me and told me everything of your wicked acts. But I can't leave your father alone like that. Shyla tacitly understood my situation and enlightened me that she would look after you" - my mom confessed.
            <br><br>
            <em>What my father is sick.</em>
            <br><br> "You always hated girls, and your behavior towards her is aberrant. I never even hoped that you would make such a nice girlfriend"- my mom said with an astonishing look. She dragged the word 'girlfriend'.
            <br>"Mom she is just a friend okay, don't start imagining things already? Okay!" - I forged.
            <br>"Okay but Shyla would be here in five, so I guess my absence wouldn't mind you" - my mom said.
            <br>"Can you say her to leave, why don't you both flip" - I said.
            <br>"No I can’t flip, after all you got a person who treats like her own father. You are really lucky son, which many desperately fail to find one" - my mom stated.<br><br> In between the conversation Shyla intruded.
            <br><br> "Huh! Here she is the girl who took care of my son without condoning my son's behavior" - my mom started again....
            <br>"No Miss Anjali your son is a good person that I have ever met. No need to mention thankyou's for looking after beloved one's." - Shyla condoned.
            <br>"Oow! So...... I guess ........... I would take a leave and let you guys have a room"
            <br>"Bye Miss Anjali say hi for me to your husband"
            <br>"OK. And you make sure that he is alright."
            <br><br>
            <em>What are these both ladies trying to intimate me. Shyla's saying beloved ones and my mom is leaving us alone in here. Is that conversation some type of woman's talk where only they can perceive it. Someone gotta write a complete reference book on woman's nature, they are really hard to understand.</em>
            <br><br> "Hey thanks for looking after me" - I thanked her.
            <br>She made a cute face moving her hair over the ears. She looks at me in a conducive way that I can't stop looking at her. Is this the way woman look at guys when they are in love.
            <br><br> "You don't have to thank me" - she said.
            <br>"Yeah friends don't thank each other"- I said
            <br>"So what are you gonna do after you get back home" - she questioned me in a glorifying way.
            <br>"Well I am gonna look at the photo album which I clicked" - I said.
            <br>"I know your mom told me that, so that's why I brought it in here"
            <br>"Really you did?"
            <br><br> "Yeah of course, I even bought you something to wear since you look adorable in those clothes that they gave you"<br> "Thank you!, Let me take a quick shower and have a look together at my album"
            <br>"Take your time and don't do any weird stuff while taking a shower"
            <br>"No mention, I promise you that I would just have a normal shower. OK!"

            <br>Had a quick shower, but the thing is I just forgot to bring a towel in.
            <br><br> "Hey do you mind to grab a towel over there and pass it to me"
            <br>"Oh! Not a problem"
            <br>She came towards me with a towel in her hands. She held her hands in the air. In the process of taking a towel I accidentally touched her finger's. Our eyes met again, but it was so intense this time then before.
            <br><br>
            <em>Not this time, it's not what good boys do to a girl who took care of you. This is not how you repay your royalty.</em>
            <br><br> "Thank you!" - I said and broke the ice and shut the door.
            <br><br> After a couple of minutes I came out with a refreshed look. She was hanging on the bed with a distance left for me so that I can join.
            <br><br>
            <em>Is it okay if I sit next to her?</em>
            <br><br> "Okay? I am gonna sit on the chair and we would take a look at my pictures together" - I stated juxtaposing my question.
            <br>"Hey come on sit next to me, not a problem for me to hang with a nice person like you whom I could certainly rely on" - she prompted.
            <br>"Okay just give me some space to hop in"
            <br>"Sure...?"
            <br><br>
            <br>I sat next to her. She was so close to me. She cuddled her hands around my left arm and laid her head on my shoulder. I couldn't say no to her not anymore. I opened the album of my adventures and my pictures. She just kept getting closer
            and closer for every page that I turned. We spent almost an hour watching the pictures which barely had barely filled 10 envelopes. After an hour she asked me in a soothing way to read a book that her mom liked the most.
            <br><br> She said me that her mom wrote that book about their love story. It seems to be her favorite book.
            <br>"I read this book everyday before bed. It's the only memory that my mom left for me" - she said touching the exterior of the book.
            <br>"Let me read it for you" - I said.
            <br><br> Opening the book I noticed that there was a picture of Shyla's parents in a wedding hall. "You look just like your mom, and I can see that the picture depicts of their marriage day" - I said.
            <br><br> "Yeah, it was their marriage day. They got lucky soon, and my mom realized that she was pregnant. But I my guardian told me that my mom had cancer soon and died after a year of having me. My father was not able to face the fact that
            my mom passed away and eventually he attrition to death." - she grieved placing her head close to mine.
            <br><br> I held my palm on her face, and said - "Life isn't always fare to everyone, but you got me."<br><br>
            <em>Did I just say that I am there for her, I guess there's a mystical spell around her.</em>
            <br><br> Then she kissed my check. I pulled my arm from her and held it around her waist. She didn't say anything about it. She held her ears close to my heart, as if she was pleased to hear my heart beat. She cuddled around my other shoulder
            tightly.
            <br><br> I can smell the fragrance of her hair. I placed my lips above her hair and kissed her.<br>
            <em>Am I lost in love completely, is there no way getting the other way around.</em>
            <br><br> Then I read the first sentence of her mom's book aloud.
            <br><br>
            <em>"The day when you can't deny a person's affection, that is the day when you found yourself.............."</em><br><br>
        </div>
        <div id="chapter 12">
            We spent the whole night holding on towards each other. The only unconventional thing that I noticed was Shyla was looking even more cuter in her sleep. I never knew that some girls had a mesmerizing smile while they are asleep. I couldn't take my eyes
            of her.<br>
            <br> I took my hand of her waist and held my palm on her hair and pulled the particle of hair that was lying on her nozzle and held it back over her ears. Then I held my fingers on her shoulder.<br> I guess this is what sleeping beauty looks
            like to a guy who never been a flirt with girls.<br><br>

            <i>She looks cute than any girl I ever saw that they portrait in movies .
            Where are those abhorring thoughts which I perceived about girls. This girl completely filled a gap in my chasm, the way I think about girls.<br>
            I hunched upon god's creature, whether he really wanted both men and woman to live together happily ever after or is it something else he wanted?</i>
            <br><br> I aroused her sleep mistakenly. But she was still asleep I guess. I began to grin watching her little smile which she held on her face. I was never so happy anytime, why am I so happy all of a sudden.
            <br><br> Am I envying her love for me. Whatever might be the reason I am adroitly adulating her which I never did for any girl.
            <br><br>
            <i>Is this the only reason which forfeited inner me to take a leave. Or is he gone forever?</i>
            <br> It's almost 21:00 hours and one of the hospital staff member knocked the door twice and informed us that he brought some food. Shyla woke up and moved approached the door and grabbed some food from the food wagon which he brought. She
            said thanked him with a fascinating smile.
            <br><br> "Okay wake up let's have some food" - she ordered me.
            <br> "Not unless you feed me again" - I said.
            <br> "No, a change of plan you are gonna feed me this time" - she said with a wink look at me.
            <br> "Okay let me wash my hands"<br> "Yeah grab the sanitizer to your right" - she insisted.
            <br> "Okay come quickly over here"
            <br><br> She sat with one leg folded on the cot and other leg down to earth. I started to whirl the food and took some amount of rice nicely mixed with the toppings and put it right onto her mouth. She started to shed tears after the first
            intake of food.<br><br> "Hey why are you crying"
            <br> "No I ain't, they are called happy tears"
            <br> "Really, but why all of a sudden" - I said with astonishment.
            <br> "I never had a chance to have food like this from my mom. I always felt sad every time I watch a little baby. I wish I had one, but I don't regret it at all after having a person like you"
            <br><br>
            <i>She was literally crying doesn't matter what she calls it. Gotta change her state of mind now. </i>
            <br><br> I swiped my thumb finger over one of her eyes and tasted a small bit of her so called happy tears.
            <br> "What my English teacher said was right, happy tears always tastes so delightful don't they?" - I questioned her.
            <br> "Hmmm! You have a lot of sense of humor. That's the foremost reason why I adore you" - she said.
            <br> "A happy face again. You are spontaneous." - I acknowledged.
            <br><br>

            <i>Should I discuss what she did late evening yesterday. Does it portrait me as a jerk if I discus such thing with a girl. But we both tacitly know what we did.</i><br><br> "The doctor informed me that I can discharge tomorrow"
            <br> "Yeah finally out of this place"
            <br> "So what then, what are you gonna do?"
            <br><br>
            <i>What does she mean by that, does she wants a verbal conformation that I love her too?</i>
            <br><br> "Don't know really, I guess I would take the easy path this time"
            <br> "Hmmm! so........?"<br> "So............"
            <br> "Do you wanna come with me tomorrow morning to a special place" - she requested.
            <br> "It depends on you" - I replied.
            <br> "Okay for now lets just go upstairs"
            <br> "Sure so you kind of a geek now like me"
            <br><br> "Let's just find out?"
            <br><br> We headed towards the terrace which was above the 15th floor. There were two blankets and one cup and a hot coffee flask. <i>She planned this thing already.</i><br><br> "Are we expected here?" - I asked her with bewilderness.
            <br> "Yeah it's me expecting you to have a view over this amazing sky which has been waiting for us"
            <br> "You got a lot of vacant fantasies, which are about to be fulfilled by someone"
            <br> "That's why I have you, no need of anyone else"
            <br><br>
            <i>She is lost with my unconditional love. No way I can loose her no matter what my ego daunts me of.</i>
            <br><br> I sat down on one of the blanket and deemed how we both gonna have coffee.
            <br> "Hey there's only one cup in here, did you forget the other one?"
            <br> "No I did it on purpose."
            <br><br>
            <i>What is she trying to say? Is this some kind of downsizing or something?</i>
            <br><br> She sat next to me and snuggled the blanket around us. She then pour the coffee in the cup and insisted me to have it first. I took a sip. Then she took it from me and she laid her lips just where I left from and took a sip.
            <br> It's so romantic of her. Everyone dreams of this kind of stuff right? Don't you?
            <br> Our eyes met deeply while she continued to have the coffee.<br>
            <br>"My coffee never tasted so good, after all this years I wasn't expecting such a taste" - she said.<br>
            <br>I became inarticulate after watching her do that. Then after a while we laid down and she as usual held her ears near the vicinity of my heart beat and the other on my shoulder. I just kept looking at the stars, hoping to wish upon a star
            so that this relation between us just keeps getting better.
            <br><br> She kissed on my check again and went back to sleep.
            <br><br> After a while, she whispered - "Do you wanna feel my heart beat too?"
            <br>"No, I do not want to do that. It's not appropriate to touch a girl in those places" - I confessed.
            <br>"Yeah but you are not a stranger or a friend to me. Come over here"
            <br>She held her hands around my head and dragged me towards her breast. Like I said I was stoned. But I can feel her warmth affection that she had been showing towards me.
            <br><br> I feel like we are made for each other.
            <br><br> I fell asleep in her arms. I didn't wanted to make a move anymore after she treating me like a adorable just born baby. So I remained aloof. We spent that whole night sharing the luminous light from the stars and the moon together.
            <br><br> I kissed the place where she wore a platinum wearing around her neck. Then she kissed me back above my head holding me more tighter then before. I wasn't able to take a gulp of oxygen with she holding me so tight. So I snuggled a
            bit which led her to loosen me a bit.
            <br> Then she kissed me again in the forehead.
            <br><br>"Do you remember what I said the other day while you were unconscious." - she said.<br><br>
            <i>She is deliberately testing me? She want's to hear me saying that again.</i>
            <br><br> "No I said. Those things doesn't gotta be said. They convey implicitly whether said or not" - I stated.
            <br>Then she kissed me on the lips knowing that I understood her coded message.
            <br> She was uncontrollable. I have to stop her before things get way too out of my hands.<br><br> "Shyla? Let's just slow down a bit okay. We are adults now. So everything that we do, has a consequence." - I alleged her.
            <br> "Okay darling, accepted and reflected the same" - she said. After that she smooched me for a long time and then fell asleep.
            <br><br> She is one such kind of girl that every guy covet's to be with. But only a few get such kind of girls, I believe that I am the lucky one.
            <br><br>
            <i>Ain't I?</i>
            <br>...............................
        </div>
        <div id="chapter 13">
            I woke up by the blitz of wind all of a sudden. When I peeked at my watch it's 3:00 hrs in the morning. When I looked at Shyla she  was still having that mistletoe smile. I mean she looks like a just born baby whom we would like to stare at all day long.<br>
            <br> I placed my palm on her hair and swiped my thumb finger over her adorable lips. I could spend the whole day watching her, acting paralyzed in here.
            <br><br>
            <em>Is this what life is all about. Man I don't want such kind of life. But maybe, it may not be the same with this girl. Maybe we may not be a bourgeoisie kind of couple.</em>
            <br><br>
            <em> What I mean is those who get married and raise children and sacrifice their dreams to ensure their kids accomplish their fantasies.</em>
            <br><br> I woke up and started to walk towards the cliff. Started to think if this is worth it. I started to visualize how three little words can make a heart open.
            <br><br> After hearing those words my perspectives have changed completely. Now I don't really care what people think or what they  believe.
            <br><br>
            <em>I can presume that I can spend forever the rest of my life holding her hands locked in a invisible lock held together. Am I lost like every other jerk who fall in love, and vaporizes his own dreams and goals for her.</em>
            <br><br> Something's gotta be done, if I feel like this thing between us is obviating me from my goals and dreams I am gonna certainly break up things with Shyla.  <br> <em>  There's no other fucking option that I am left with. Success is my only fucking option, I can't afford to fail anymore like every other family dude. </em>
            <br><br> Spent a couple of hours just thinking about this issue. Maybe not a issue literally, it's about me and some kind of family thing.<br><br>
            <em>Dude just chill already, it's gonna be fine. It's not gonna be like what you think would be with her.</em>
            <br><br> I had a terrible breathe, I gotta brush my teeth now.
            <br><br>
            <em>Should I wake her it's like 4:00 hours in the morning. She might be tired, better just let her sleep.</em>
            <br><br> I quickly got down to my room and freshened up my dozy face and brushed up with a toothpaste that contained mint flavor.<br>
            <em>She told me that we were about to go somewhere and she insisted me to get myself ready in the morning. Why not take a shower right away? </em>
            <br><br> The hospital was so silent that I could clearly hear the sound of the shower sprinkling. Looked myself in the mirror for a while and said to myself - "Not this time buddy, don't be mean to her. She loves you more than anyone else's
            in this world."
            <br><br> She even bought me a nice dress, a formal one actually. Wore it and got back to her. The time was almost like 4:30 hours now.
            <br><br> She is still sleeping. I went near her and kneed down to her. She was awake and placed her fingers on my check. Looking at me with her cute dozy eyes.
            <br><br> "Hey you are up so early" - she said.
            <br>"Yeah, you told me so."
            <br>"Hmm! it's strange that you still remember that"
            <br>"Of course why not?"
            <br><br>
            <em>Oh my gosh! She has a terrible breath. I can't breathe already.</em>
            <br><br> She pulled my head closer towards hers. I was frozen with excitement, she slides her head a bit and we closed our eyes and shared the same breaths.
            <br><br>
            <em>It feels good though, her original organic taste. I guess this is what happens when you are married. Give your spouse a kiss whenever they like to. Isn't it?</em>
            <br><br> We pulled apart near the wall to lean on. I was leaning actually. We were unable to hold back anymore. Her hands worked all over my body. I castigated her curvy figure exploring more. <br>We had a passionate kiss which every one desires
            for. Then I leaned softly kissing her up and down her neck and worked back to tender back on her lips. <br>While we were kissing she drags the collar of my shirt and starts to move her lips over my neck. She was pulling my shirt so intensely,
            like I thought it's gonna tear apart.
            <br><br> I pulled myself back and held her shoulder with my both hands and said -"Hey we are going to fast I guess?"
            <br>"Okay let's slow down then" - she said in a low voice exhilarated by the tension between our lips.
            <br><br> She was still feeling dozy and I thought that she might slip while getting down through the stairs. So I decided why not carry her like a baby?
            <br>I bent down till her thighs and placed one arm near her shoulder and the other below her thighs.
            <br><br>"Hey what are you doing?"
            <br>"Just caring for you if you don't mind"
            <br>"Hmm! For this cruel behavior I have to chastise you"
            <br>"Okay I am ready for it, when are you actually planning to do it?"
            <br><br> I slowly walked down the stairs. She held her hands around my neck for support. <br><em>God she has that mystic look at me again.</em>
            <br><br> She had a beautiful hair which she held it free. I guess she might weight approximately around 55kgs. She never worked out I hope. But she still maintains her physic. Then I got to my room. She opened the door and got down from my
            arms slowly just the way kids do.
            <br><br> "I think I am gonna take a shower"- she said.
            <br>"Okay I will be waiting outside then"
            <br>"No you can stay here, not a problem for me"
            <br><br>
            <em>What is she up to?</em>
            <br><br>"No I would wait outside"
            <br>"Hey if you are gonna wait outside, then whom do you think is gonna hand me a towel?"
            <br>"Oh okay! okay! I would sit over there, I guess?"
            <br>"That's better"
            <br><br><em>No one can corroborate with her demand. She always overpowers me in an argument.</em>
            <br>I sat on the chair side to the cot. Then after a while she called me.
            <br>"Darling, can you hand me over the towel please"
            <br><br> I picked the towel and went towards the restroom door. She held it open where I can peek a slight of the room. She talks more with her eyes and her meticulous gestures. I couldn't perceive her message this time. I handed her the towel
            and turned back. But she still held the door opened.
            <br><br>
            <em>Does she want me to come in. No way I am gonna do that. Sorry Shyla, I am not that type of guy.</em>
            <br><br> ..................................
            <br><br> After a couple of minutes she came out. The only thing that prevents her from me seeing naked is the towel that she held around her. I turned back again. She did her usual business.
            <br>"You can turn towards me now" -she said.
            <br>Still she was half naked. I never saw a girl like this close until now.
            <br>"Hey can you help me wear a saree" -she requested.
            <br>A saree is a garment consisting of a length of cotton or silk elaborately draped around the body, traditionally worn by women from South Asia.
            <br><br> "You want to attire yourself in a saree" - I questioned her with an awe look. "Yeah why not, I got the green one which is your favorite" - she said.<br><br>
            <em>I always had a daunting desire to see a girl in a green saree. I love green a lot and always liked to see woman who wore it.</em>
            <br><br> She knows a lot about me than her. I removed the cover of the saree and steeped towards her. I first went near her back and tightened the blouse, and directed her to do in such a way as I saw it woman do. I was doing the opposite
            of what I have seen.<br> You guys know what I am saying in here.<br><br>
            <em>Does she think that I know how to wear a saree.</em>
            <br><br> Then she said me to close my eyes.
            <br><br><em>Is she doing her final touchup? She looks gorgeous though.</em>
            <br>"Open your eyes now"- she whispered coming close to my ears.
            <br><em>Amazing! She is just the way as I always imagined to be. She looks like an ideal wife. I feel like marrying her right away.</em>
            <br><br>
            <br>"How do I look?"
            <br>"You look insanely stunning, I can't describe you anymore"
            <br>She then snatched my hand and held it near her hips. Then she held her hands around my head and pulled me a little closer. I moved my other hand over her shoulder. Then we shared the same breath for a couple of minutes. This time she was
            not so vigorous.
            <br><br>
            <br>"Okay let's go now" - she sighed in my ears.
            <br>It's almost 7:50 hours and began to think how come the time has passed away so quickly. While we were walking our way out we were accosted by my mom.
            <br><br>
            <br>"Hey guys where you heading to?"
            <br>"Aunty, I am willing to take your son to a special place with your permission"
            <br>"What if I don’t let you?"
            <br>"You shouldn't say that please"
            <br>"Okay adorable girl, have a nice day."
            <br>"Thank you! Aunty. Thank you so much!"
            <br>"How are you planning to go?"
            <br>"Not sure really?"
            <br>"Okay here, take my car keys and promise me to drive safe"
            <br>"Sure aunty"
            <br>"One more thing I request you to not let my zealous son grab the wheels. Will you?"

            <br>"I would certainly make it has my personal mission to not let him drive"
            <br>"Good and return back home before the sunset"
            <br>"OK, Aunty Bye."
            <br><br>
            <em>Did my mom just let me go with her? Does she think that we are on a date? Shit!</em>
            <br><br>
            <br>Then she told me to sit next to her. She started the engine and drove me to a place which was not known to me.
            <br><br> At a certain vintage point she smiled at me.
            <br><br>
            <em>This girl is way too out of my league.</em><br><br>
        </div>
        <div id="chapter 14">
            <em>Her eyes convey me the message in a cryptic way. She is not gonna say where she's taking me? Already?. She is culminating the path. Where she's gonna take me?</em><br>
            <br>
            <em>Huh! When this journey's gonna end, I am fucking tired, already. Maybe I should just signal her that I am tired.</em>
            <br><br> She kept on driving on and on. I just hoped that this endless journey comes to an end. We drove for about 3hrs till now. And she is not even giving a sigh that we are here.<br> "Did you forget the route. Why don't you just stop by
            and ask someone." - I muttered after a long silence.<br> "Don't have to, because we almost reached the place"<br> "Oh! At last. So where are we actually?"<br> "Just hold on, it's a surprise"<br> "Surprise for me or you?"<br> "Shhh! Keep quiet
            or else I am gonna make us both walk till there"
            <em>She's is one bossy girl too.</em><br><br> After a couple of minutes I can see vast agriculture lands cultivating rice, cotton and some other usual crops that yield good result during summer season. The place is empty, like we are the only
            humans on earth left to starve. Just kidding. The place may be like 60 acres of agricultural land and I sighted even a Rice mill at one corner near the horizon at a walk able distance.
            <br><br> "So you are here so that we can enjoy the loneliness in here?"
            <br>"Get out of the car right now"
            <br>"What are you crazy, it's burning out in there"
            <br>"Just get the fuck out of the car"<br><br>
            <em>Now she's talking my language.</em><br><br> "Do you really mean it?"<br>
            <br>"Yes" - she yelled with a disdain look at me.
            <br>Suddenly the happy relation between us turned out to be a debacle.
            <br><em>Why's she started acting so strange without any concern. Did I gesticulated anything wrong about her. Why?</em>
            <br><br> I got out with angry face at her and completely filled with red chilies filled stacked up in my brain.<br>
            <em>This vast land, why isn't there a single human over here? Are they being banged somewhere else in this hot sizzling weather. Fuck it!</em>
            <br><br> Then she came out of the car, with a smiling face.<br>
            <em>Why she's smiling at me, Now?</em><br><br> "So this is your plan, to see me roasted like a chicken kept in a oven?"
            <br>"Not sure but what I can say is that this vast land belongs to me"
            <br>"Huh! So that's it?"
            <br>"Are you not happy?"
            <br>"Happy for what?"
            <br>"This is my property"
            <br>"Look even if this is your property or not, I don't care because it's not mine which I bought with my own money"
            <br>"I thought you would be happy!"
            <br>"Never, unless and until I grow huge making a lot of money by myself"
            <br>"You are different, than I thought"
            <br><br>
            <em>How does she expect me to be happy, seeing her inherited wealth. Maybe some guys may be covet enough about her wealth, but not me.</em>
            <br><br> She came towards me and cuddled around my back. I guess she got the answer that she has been looking for.<br> "Sorrrrryyyyyyyyyyyy" - she said dragging the word.
            <br>"So why are we exactly here?"
            <br>"I wanted to talk to you about something"
            <br>"Go on"
            <br>"Come on let's take a walk through the woods"
            <br><br> We started to walk under the shade of the mango trees which mentioned it as woods. It's literally called as a stroll instead of calling it as a walk which I hated the most. She held her arms around mine and started to stroll watching
            the sky.<br><br> "I guess my parents knew that someday their kid might not be with them or maybe their time has come to say their final goodbye's. They decided to invest in agriculture so that I meet my daily expenses to live happily again"<br><br>            "The result of their decision is this huge acres of agricultural land and the rice mill over there." - she said.<br> "When they started to buy this stuff actually" - I questioned her aloofly.
            <br>"When my mom knew that she was pregnant" - she replied.
            <br>"Oh! I guess your parents are a fast boomer's" - I said.
            <br><br> "Yeah they are, I guess they didn't want their daughter to be dormanted in an orphanage" - she said.
            <br><br> "You are really lucky, you know. Many parents don't get to that extend of thinking about me like your parent's did" - I said.
            <br>"Yeah I wish they are with me too"
            <br>"Of course they are with you"
            <br>"How? Enlighten me with constructive thoughts"
            <br>"They are near you whenever you feel their caring affection they showered upon you, when you were in your mother's womb fighting desperately to get out."
            <br><br> I guess that poetic sentence of mine broke her heart. She's a maudlin lady now. <br>She seems to be desperately abjected by my catalytic words. She quickly ran towards a wooden bench built in between the mango trees. She started to
            weep so desperately placing her finger's on her forehead.
            <br>Maybe I was too straightforward. She misconstrued my words.
            <br><br> "I come to this place each year of my parent's anniversary. I sleep on their grave hoping that I they would come to see me"
            <br>"I wished that they may come back to see me just for one night, so that I could fulfill all my dreams as a little girl"
            <br>"Every year I come to this place with a smile, and go back with unfilled desires" - she said howling all the sadness she held back for all these years.
            <br><br> Heart feels lightened when you share your sorrow with someone you trust. I guess she has never found someone to share these things until now.
            <br><br>
            <em>Should I stop her. No, let her cry. I guess that's the only way she is gonna come back to normal. Hopefully crying is the only way to soothe her pain.</em>
            <br><br> I kept watching her without uttering a word. Then she kept on going from starting from her parent's to her grandparent's death before she was born. She even held my hands in hers and told me that she picturized me as his father. And
            then she mourned morbidly for her parent's death.
            <br><br> She got down to earth and cuddled around my legs and started to weep copiously.
            <br><em>Should I stop her now or not?</em>
            <br>I got down to her pulling her away from my legs. "Hey! Hey! Stop crying. What are you crying about, you got me" - I said. The water started to weep in my eyes after watching her.
            <br><br> Maybe she didn't even got a chance to mourn for her parent's death with a generous person. Well she did now that's gonna make her feel alright. Her eyeliner started to dissolve with her tears and it started to appear as she was crying
            black water.
            <br><br> "Hey look at me"
            <br>"Come on look at me now"
            <br>"Look there's one thing that I was daunting to say to you"
            <br>"Baby I love you more than I do for myself"
            <br>"I never knew woman could be so amazing unless and until I met you"
            <br>"You are my everything"
            <br>"It's you me and us from now on"
            <br><br> She leashed out even more tears. But there was a little sign of smile in her eyes which she gesticulated. I kissed her forehead and said -"I love you, and I don't care if you wont"
            <br>She held her hands around my neck and hugged me. Even I cuddled my arms around her rigidly.
            <br>"Now I don't have to imagine my father anymore in my dreams, because I got you" - she hummed in my ears.
            <br>She hugged me sturdily. Which made me incompetent to refuse it. We posed in this position for enough time, in which an tyro artist could have drawn an excellent painting. Then I move my palm over her hair gently. She held around her arms
            even more tighter then before.<br> "I love you, Kumar" - she muttered with a harmonious sound which pleased me to hear.<br><br> "Come let me show you my house where my parent's used to live" She grabbed my hands and made me run with her about
            a mile.
            <br><br> The house lavish but not big like a mansion. It's was small and simple from outside. She opened the door with her fingerprint. When I came inside the house it looked so great which everyone wishes to have one. She showed me the entire
            house. <br>It was a 7 bedroom house with a eclectic interior designing. Their parent's might have been particular about the house which her daughter was supposed to live in.
            <br><br> "Hmm! Nice house." - I said.<br> "Yeah the house feels like home after having you in here" - she said.
            <br><br> I made myself in the house after perching in one of the couch. Then she sat near me. The sunlight deemed into the house through chasm located at an oblique angle above the main door.
            <br><br> Then she gave a passionate look at me. <em>Maybe I should ask her to marry me right away.</em><br> "Baby is there a place in this house with a divine source"<br> "What do you mean?"<br> "I mean any hanging's with a god painting or
            a portrait"
            <br>"Yeah follow me..."
            <br><br>..................
            <br><br> While walking my way I noticed two rings being placed in the showcase. I grabbed it and kept it inside my pocket. Then she showed me one a painting with Jesus in it. She was a Christian and I was a Hindu. But those things doesn't
            matter now. <br>I bent down on my knees and asked her to marry me.
            <br>"Ouhhhh! Darling are you serious?"<br> "Yes, Shyla. I am dead serious."<br> "But? We are just 18."<br> "Doesn't matter."<br> "But it matters to me."<br>
            <em>Is she rejecting me. I got this, I know what to do exactly.</em>
            <br><br> Then I got up and she within a blink I inserted the ring in her finger. She was shocked and was hesitating - "Kumar, what have you done? This is no joke."<br> "I said I am dead serious. You are my wife now. If you don't like it, throw
            the ring right on my face." - I stated bluntly.<br> Then she hesitated a bit and stared at the ring.<br> "These were my parent's wedding rings, I kept them as my memory. But I have them now. And I can't even remove it just like that. These
            rings mean something" - she said.<br>
            <br><br>Then she did the same thing to me back.<br><br> "We are a couple now" - I said with a low voice. Then she stared at me for a while and she grabbed my hands and took me to a bedroom above the hallway.<br> "Baby" - even before uttering
            that word she shut my lips with her fingers.
            <br>"We are a couple now and I am yours. It doesn't matter now what the world thinks of us" - she said.
            <br><br> She dragged me inside the room and she shut the door by herself. Then she undressed herself first starting from her toes. Then she came towards me and wraps her hands around me kissing my neck. I placed my hands around her and unhooked
            her blouse and her bra.
            <br><br> She then unbuttoned my shirt and throwed it away. I can feel her soft touch of her skin. One touch is all that matters and it electrified me, hormones rising up to an intense degree.
            <br><br> She was close enough for me to smell her body odor, kissing starts from there. It was like we were directed in some means to do this the right way. Then I carried her towards the bed and placed her with a soft touch on the mattress.
            We locked our eyes for a moment to make sure everything is alright. Then I started my business working my way starting from her toes.
            <br><br> I can't describe her intense passionate look at her when I placed her gently on the bed. Kissing her toes moving forward gently below her hip to pulling her underpants. <br>Gently moved near her breasts watching her reaction bit by
            bit and I could feel the warmness in my mouth and heard her first moan escaping her lips.<br> She then placed her hands on back of my shoulder and the other one holding my fingers.<br><br> It was passionate thing which we had and I couldn't
            describe anymore. She then rolled over and kissed me back and forth on my lips. We shared the same breath till I lashed out.<br> Just a few seconds after that she wailed taking a deep breath and falling back on me. She held her head near my
            ears and whispered - "I would never forget this day in my life".<br> "Me too because I am your loving husband now" - I said in a low pitched voice. She smiled with a sizzling sound in my ears.
            <br><br> "OK, Now remember one thing. Anytime when you are with another girl, just remember that there is a sweet wife of yours waiting for you." - she said.
            <br><br> Then she fell asleep side to me. I put a blanket over her and even placed my fingers on her face and starred with amusement and with a lot of affection.
            <br><br>
            <em>I got a loving wife now, I gotta take a good care of her without compromising on my dreams or hers.</em>
            <br><br> "I promise you Shyla, I promise you. You can count on me."<br><br>
        </div>
        <div id="chapter 15">
            We shared our breath for an hour. It was like we were made for this thing. No not just for this thing, I mean to live together coalesce as one soul. Is this what true happiness feels like or maybe not even better than this.<br><br> "Hey baby,
            what you wanna be apart from a being a mother?"<br> "Not sure, but I always had a dream of being a business woman"<br> "Cool, you would be one"<br> "So what do you wanna be?"<br> "I don't know maybe a entrepreneur I hope"<br> "In which area"<br>            "Technology"
            <br> "You sound like one when you talk" - she said staring at me.
            <br><br>
            <em>She's really saying that. When I told this to one of my friends they laughed and disparaged me that I would never be one.</em>
            <br><br> "Baby I love you more than anything else and I can't afford to lose you. Do you get it?" - I asked her in a melancholy voice having a fixed stare at her pretty eyes. She then got up a bit so that she can have a clear view of my face
            and was certainly naked.
            <br><br> It was almost 19:00 hours and the room was dissolving darkness. Their aren't even any neighbors near this house. I think their parents liked full privacy so that there's nothing obviating them from having fun.
            <br><br> "Hey! I get it darling. You are my husband now, which makes me a part of you" - she said. I couldn't stop staring at her breast which she didn't cover them up.
            <br>"Baby why don't you just get dressed up now"
            <br>"Why are you trying to seduce me again"
            <br>"Hope not. Are you incompetent enough towards sensible touch?"
            <br>A broad passionate smile in her face and her eyes daunting me to kiss her again.
            <br>She came closer towards my lips and smooched me over and over again.<br> "Baby put on some clothes now" - I requested her civilly. She then put her bra on the usual place back.
            <br>"Can you help me hook it?"
            <br>"Sure why not"
            <br>It was too tight fit for her size. "Don't you think that it's a tight fit for your body shape?"
            <br>"Yeah it's a girls secret which is to be kept as a secret"<br><br>
            <em>Girls secret really, I am her husband now. Why not just ask her. No she may think me as a lecher person trying to snoop girls secret's.</em>
            <br><br> "So do you wanna get back?" - she asked shaping up her body after hooking the bra.<br><br>
            <em>Does she really mean to get back. In case we go back what am I gonna tell my mom. Should I tell her that your son just got married and did the usual stuff people do after marriage. Whatever happens let it happen, but I can't loose this sassy girl. </em>
            <br><br> "Would you like to move in?"
            <br>"Move in where?"
            <br>"I don't know. Maybe we could?"
            <br>"Hey look at me, just because we are married doesn't mean that we got to live together" - she said with a delightful sound convincing me that she's right.
            <br>"So you mean that we just get back like nothing ever happened?"
            <br>"No!!! you don't get it. We still live together as a couple but in different places"
            <br>"Baby please don't talk like this. I can manage it"
            <br>"Darling it's not about you managing it, it's about our future and goals. Nothing should deviate us from achieving them right?"
            <br><br>
            <em>She was right, she thinks just like I do. Maybe she was my alter ego in the past life.</em>
            <br><br> "Darling focus on your dreams. It doesn't mean that we are a tearing apart. I would always be your wife and in case you imagine anyone else other than me, then I would make sure to give a hard kick on your butt."
            <br><br> I smiled looking at her childish gestures she made while talking about kicking my butt. "I wouldn't imagine anyone else but you. And you promise me the same back" - I said placing my hand still in the air.
            <br>"I promise that I would always be a loyal wife to Kumar" - she avowed placing her palm over mine.
            <br><br> "Now let's go I made a promise to your mom that I would get you back to her soon"<br> "Baby should we have to go, maybe I was thinking like why not go tomorrow early morning"<br>
            <br> "You think a lot, now come on dressen up and let's get going"
            <br>"Haaa! please baby, please"
            <br>"No way come on hurry up now"
            <br><br><em>She is not gonna let me stay here neither she would.</em>
            <br>I got up and tried to find my clothes which she threw away. I found my clothes scattered here and there in the room. She started to dress up in a Saree, staring herself in the mirror.
            <br><br> I got near her and cuddled around her back. Now we both started to stare each other in the mirror.
            <br>"Look how pretty my wife is looking at me"
            <br>"And see how charming my husband is in praising his only wife"
            <br>"You know I never thought I would get married and not this soon."
            <br>"I know, even I never thought I would fall in love with you and take it up to marriage."- she said.<br> "Can I ask you something?" - I said.
            <br><br> "Why did you fall in love with me and how come you relied on me when I asked you to marry me?"<br> "You felt like my father when you showed your caring for me. It was like you are an other father whom my father sent to take care of
            her daughter."
            <br><br>
            <em>I guess girls like boys when they portrait their father's. They like guys who listens to them when they feel like talking. You just gotta listen to them not advice them.</em>
            <br><br> "And I loved you more when you were attentive in listening while is sharing my sorrow's with you" - she said placing her palm's on my face.
            <br> "Now come on let's not worry your mom"
            <br>"OK, let's go"
            <br><br>...............
            <br><br> She grabbed the wheels as she promised my mom not to let me drive. I took the cleaner seat and relaxed my way out. She drives fast but not rash. She insisted me to wear a seat belt. I mean she ordered me to strap on the seat belt.
            <br><br> She then turned on some soft music which I hated. Not in a mood to hear those dreadful sounds, I quickly switched it to rap stuff. She switched it back again to the same dreadful music. Again I did the same thing, this time Eminem's
            popular 'Love the way you lie' started to play on the radio.
            <br><br> "I forfeit it" - she said.
            <br>"Cool, I won this time from my wife."
            <br>"Don't get so excited there's a long way home" - my wife said.
            <em>Man I can't believe that I just got married. Is it a dream?</em>
            <br><br> I picked up the bottle filled with water and opened it up. I splashed some water on my face. The water was chilled.
            <br><em>Man this ain't a dream. This shit is real. </em>
            <br>"What are you doing?" - my wife questioned me.
            <br>"I was hoping that this thing is not a dream" - I said lovingly to my beloved wife.
            <br>She waved a smile back at me and said -"No this is not a dream anymore, it's full of life which I am witnessing with my beloved husband."
            <br><br> I fell asleep in the car reclining the seat to suit my comfort. I didn't care about her driving since I can completely relied on her.
            <br><br> .................
            <br><br> It was almost 11:00 hours and she woke me up while I was in a deep sleep.
            <br>"Darling, wake up, up! up! up!" - she whistled using the word up.
            <br>"Few more minutes please" - I requested.
            <br>"Your mom is expecting you, she is waiting near the door."
            <br>I woke up immediately after hearing the word 'mom'.
            <br><em>Should I tell my mom about us. Or just wait for sometime like my wife said.</em>
            <br>"Hey should I talk about us with my mom?"
            <br>"Please don't do that, I don't want to break your mom's heart. She looks at me like her daughter, please don't ruin our relation by your stupid acts" - she demanded.
            <br>"Okay, give me a kiss now"
            <br>"No get off me"
            <em>We shared the same breath a few hours ago, now she's denying a kiss. Am I having a foul breath.</em>
            <br><br> I quickly checked the odor of my breath.
            <br><br> "Hey it's not that, we got to restrict our behavior towards each other. There are elderly people around here, I mean your mom and dad" - she acquitted me.
            <br><br> "Ok good night baby"
            <br>"Please make sure that you call me by your name when you are around here" - she said with a strange look at me.
            <br>"Still any demands"
            <br>"Yeah 1.No staring at me when constantly 2.No touching hands<br> 3.No babying me<br> 4.No calling me<br> 5.No walking with me<br> 6.No asking me out<br> 7.No coming near me<br>
            <br>8.No sitting next to me" - she demanded.
            <br><br>"No! No! No! a lot's of no's in your demand, are you trying to break up with me?" - I asked.
            <br>Then she turned red, and got out of the car and pulled me to the back of the truck which was parked in front of my house. And then she kissed me which I asked for and then all of a sudden she slapped me forcefully.
            <br>It was one such intense slap which I never received from anyone else till now. She was the first person to slap me.
            <br><br> "Never let that thought come in your mind again" - she said with a daunting sound.<br> I was stoned and became inarticulate, not knowing what to say which might be incongruous of the situation.
            <br>Then she walked with pace towards her house. She didn't even look back once. <br>What did I say wrong which made her slap me so fierce fully. I rubbed my checks so as not to intimidate my mom that his son just got slapped by his secret
            wife.
            <br>My mom observed something new in me I guess.
            <br><br> "You look different today then you were in the morning. What happened to you?" - my mom questioned me.
            <br><br> "Just started exploring different facets of life" - I said with one hand on my check.<br><br>
        </div>
        <div id="chapter 16">
            Morning buzz started to whip my ears, as usual. But this time it's not usual. I woke up after everyone in my house got up.<br><br>

            <em>Shit! I am late today. What the fuck is wrong with me after getting married. And what does she mean by that slap which she gave me. I am gonna sneak into her room and ask her straight away.</em>
            <br><br> I arouse from my bed and watched her from my window. She's wasn't there in her room. Stretched my arms and did the usual morning business.
            <br><br> "Can I do that, the sneaking part? Yes of course I can do that, she is my wife now for god sake" - I said to myself staring at the mirror.
            <br><br> .......................
            <br><br> "Tud! Tud! Tud!" - came the sound from the door while I was in the bathroom.
            <br><em>Someone's in my room already without my permit.</em> Opened the door with anger and impatience. Then I see her in a workout dress.
            <br><br> "What are you doing her? You told me not to break those mentioned rules" - I asked curiously examining her body.
            <br> "I said that you were restricted but not me, you gotta understand my words clearly sweet hubby"
            <br>"So why are you really here now"
            <br>"Just here to give my husband a morning breakfast"
            <br>"Really "
            <br>"Yes, and I would like to serve it with your acceptance"
            <br>"Sure and I accept my wife's love to serve me food"
            <br>"So what's the item for today"<br> "You have to taste it first and then guess it"
            <br><br> She pushed me inside the restroom and she turned on the shower and laid me down on the restroom floor. She was on top of me, while the sprinkles of water from shower was making her look more hotter.
            <br><br>"Ready to taste breakfast"
            <br>"Yeah"
            <br><br>She began giving me more of her gentle kiss, her lips were smooth as cream.Then I closed my eyes and put my hands back of her neck, winding my fingers between her soft hair. I tasted a hint of chocolate.
            <br>"chocolate" - I sighed.
            <br><br> "That was very quick, wanna try more" - she said.
            <br>"Yeah I mean like what?" - I whispered.
            <br>She turned off the shower and took some chocolate syrup and poured it on part of my body and a whole lot of it on my lips. She then began to lick it starting from the body.<br>
            <em>Shit! why is she doing this. I can't control my feelings.</em>
            <br><br> She perched near my lips and gave me a french kiss mixed with chocolate which was a hell of a taste. I never knew that we could figure out variety of kisses. Maybe I was just too immature.
            <br>"Hey breakfast is ready, come have it before it get's cold" - my mom said knocking at the door.
            <br>"Do you still want a breakfast after this"- shyla said winking at me. "You need to go now, or else we might get caught" - I said to her.
            <br><br> I got up quickly and wore a shirt to show up for breakfast in my home.
            <br>"Hey just don't forget to clean you mouth, maybe your mom might notice the that!"- shyla said.
            <br><br> "Shit!" - I yelled and ran for breakfast. She was laughing at me when I started to freaking out at the sound of my mom's voice.
            <br><br> ....................
            <br><br> "There's a spark in your face, your grandma used to say that a man's insights changes after he get's married. Now I notice the same with you, Son!" - my dad said.<br><br> "Yeah even I observed the same on him when he showed up late
            night"
            <br> "There's a glow in your face, people have this kind of glow only after next day of honeymoon usually" - my mom adjoined with my dad.
            <br><br> "Mom what are you talking about? I am just 18 years old, things change when guys are 18 ok" - I said slightly raising my took and my eyes coalesced a bit.
            <br><br> "Hmm! For that we guess we have to find out" - my dad said.
            <br> "Wait, the ring looks pretty. Where did you get it from?"
            <br>"Huhhh! It's a gift from my new friend shyla"
            <br>"Never knew that you guys where so close where she would gift you a costly wedding ring"
            <br>"Mom it's not a weeding ring OK, it's just a ring"
            <br>"It's actually a wedding ring, I can tell this because me and your mom have shopped for our's for about three days"<br> "Ohhhh! God anyways good morning dad and mom" - I said with a low pitched voice.
            <br><br>
            <em>Shit! how did they come to know the difference in my behavior. Is it true that people have this glow on face after getting married.</em>
            <br><br><em>I should have hid this ring somewhere else</em>
            <br><br>....................
            <br><br> I started to stick my ass on the chair and started learning to code. Not like the one which you might have seen in the social network, basically I just got started to learn to code a couple of weeks ago.
            <br>First thing I did before learning was I shut the door and switched off my mobile and thrown it somewhere else in the room and had a clear focus on the screen.
            <br><br> When I sat in front of the computer I am almost lost in it completely. Even put a cool headphones over my ears and started listening to Eminem's songs. I was so lost in my world that I even forgot to have food, my mom brought some
            food over for me. Just kept typing and understanding the coding language with pristine acumen. I felt like superman when I first made the computer say 'Hello world'.
            <br><br> It's been like 6 weeks for now being a married guy. I was so focused in learning which made my memory slip away from the thoughts of my loving wife. I learnt from basic programming to control flow of complex algorithms. I learnt three
            C, C++ and Java. And decided to learn Data structures and algorithms completely.
            <br><br> Runtime error's are programmers nightmares, taking a puff and checking the code again and again used to solve my problem. If you were a computer major you would probably understand what I was talking about.
            <br><br> Android and IOS development fascinated me a lot.
            <br><br>
            <em>It's been like 6 weeks from now, why don't I just have a drink. A glass of fine whisky would ameliorate my hyper activated mind.</em>
            <br><br> Pulled the mattress and thrown it away, and grabbed the costly bottle of whisky and sipped it directly. Man I was high like a gangsta. I almost drank 10% of the bottle. Started to feel disoriented, I guess the percentage of alcohol
            was more then I expected.
            <br><br> "Yo I feel high. What the fuck is happening, look at that asshole staring at me like a high league bitch looking for a customer. I am gonna hit you if you didn't stop staring at me." - I spoke out watching myself in the mirror.
            <br><br> Then I smashed the mirror by throwing my fucking phone. Like I said I was high, I didn't know what am I probably doing.<br> "Huh! that's how it's done if you don't listen to me fucker" - the intoxicated me said feeling proud after
            smashing his own candid reflection.
            <br><br>
            <em>Think I should head towards the computer shop and buy some more ram.</em>
            <br><br> I put on a hat and my jacket. I covered my eyes with glasses, since they were pale red in color. Took my mom's credit card and my dad's car keys.
            <br><br> "Hey where are you going?" - my mom questioned me.
            <br>"Mom I am just heading towards the computer shop to buy computer stuff." - I replied.<br> "It's been like 6 weeks and three days since you came down to the hallway. I am worried about your health, make sure that you take care."
            <br><br> "Mom I am fine, and I would return within a couple of minutes"
            <br>"Please drive carefully OK"
            <br>"OK mom love you"
            <br><br>
            <em>Oh! gosh my mom almost scared me to death. The good thing is wasn't caught</em>
            <br><br> Looking cool in my gangster look, the shades made me look more like a bad ass villain. I got in the car and fired it up.
            <br><br> My dad's car was sooo cool than my mom's. It's got more horsepower than my mom can handle. I broke the side mirror's five times and I ain't gonna lie. This was my dad's first car so I did what I wanna do.
            <br><br> Chilli'n in my dad's car and cruising down 8 miles to reach the computer shop. The ac is not working but I am still cool though. That's a hell of a ride but yeah it's gonna be cool. I turned the steering and stepped on the gas quickly.<br>            Bit of a rash driver though.
            <br><br>
            <em>There seems to be my old classmate from high  school. Ignore her? </em>
            <br><br>
            <em>A slut of high school...</em>
        </div>
        <div id="chapter 17">
            Bought all the necessary stuff to get started again with my usual shit. Taking a nice look at my wat<em>ch it was 19:20 hours and my mom wouldn't like me showing up late in the house. Stepped on the gas, turned on the headlig</em>hts listening
            to mocking bird sung by Eminem. I tried to emulate his voice with an abortive effort.<br><br>

            <em>Who the fuck are those guys blocking the highway.</em>
            <br><br> I stomped the horn to signal those guys to get the fuck off the road. I halted my dad's car until they cleared the way out. I guess they were trying to be mean to me.<br><br> They didn't clear the way yet. I hope they were trying
            to pick up a fight with me. I got out of the car and moved forward towards those assholes.
            <br><br> "YO! Can you please clear the way out my mom's gonna kill me if I show up late in the house" - I said civilly.
            <br>"Douche just stay back for a couple of minutes" - one of those assholes replied belittling my request.<br><br> "Dude i<em>t's almost 18:00 hours now, I am in a hurry. Don't you </em>get it get the fuck out of the road and go somewhere
            else and do your asshole shit Fucker's" - I said taking breaths spontaneously with a elusive look at them.
            <br><br> "What did you just say?"<br> "I said get our ass off the road and go someplace else to finish your shit" Then a sudden blow on my head from back. They just hit me with a wooden stick. Squeezed my palm back of my head it was like a
            sudden punch in the ass. Struggled a lot to get to normal.
            <br><br>
            <em>What should I do now? I know what to do. Kick these guys and show what real pain looks like.</em>
            <br><br> "Sir please let me go now. You did what you wanted to do" - I said with a low pitched voice dissipating the pain out.
            <br>"Really do you think we gonna let you go just like that"
            <br>"What more are you expecting from me?"
            <br>"We would like you to call your girlfriend or sister and say her to come over here. Then we would let you go"
            <br>Then all of a sudden I can see the memories of Shyla in my brain. Just like a sudden spark I retrospected the love which she cherished on me. Almost everything I retrieved back.
            <br><br>
            <em>How did I ever effaced Shyla from my mind? Have I been so busy with my shit which eluded me from my wife. I gotta see her and cuddle my arms around her all night, till she forgives me.</em>
            <br><br> "Dude get back to earth, I guess she must be soo hot to handle? Call her and say her to come here soon my boys are waiting" - one of those disoriented ugly faced guy said.<br> There were like three of them. One seems to be a girl
            who has been staying inside the car staying aloofly.
            <br>"For what do you want me to call her?"
            <br>"It's been such a long time since me and my friend got laid. If you wanna get out of this shit, you better call up on your cell phone quickly".
            <br><br>
            <em>Motherfucker's why just they go and lay their mom for some intercourse.</em>
            <br><br>
            <em> Guys who tries to assault a woman should depart from this earth. Even if I get these guys to the cops, they are gonna arose back on me or Shyla which doesn't seems to be a good plan.</em>
            <br><br>
            <em> Think Kumar, think pristine enough or else they are gonna hurt your wife.</em><br><br> "Sir why not let me get you to her, which might save you a couple of minutes" - I said with a obedient look in my face.
            <br>"Now you get it. Good! let's go now come on you are driving my car" - one of them said with excitement.
            <br><em>Maybe I should just let them have my wife for a couple of minutes? Maybe I should make a persuasive deal with them? Maybe I should just let it go.</em>
            <br><br> Drove the car with a heavy metal music which they had. Didn't think of anything and just held my eyes on the road. They didn't accept my request of asking them to travel in my dad's car. I hope that my dad's car stays safe over there.
            <br><br> Late night almost 19:04 hours and I took the long way home. Slowed down the engine and stopped the car side by the road. They fell asleep in their seats. Without making a noise I leaned my hands and woke the guy siting next to the
            driver seat.<br> "Hey sir, we almost reached."
            <br>"Really?"
            <br>"Yeah, and I don't want you to make noise. Let's talk outside the car. Shhhhhh!"
            <br>"But why?"
            <br>"I will tell you, just come outside"
            <br>"Cool"
            <br><br> We both got out of the car and I quickly locked all the door's with the keys they gave me. We started walking.<br> "So why did you signaled me to remain silent?" - he said.
            <br>"I wanted to make you an offer"
            <br>"like what?"
            <br>"I was hoping that why not a handsome hunk like you have a passionate sex with my girlfriend all alone without any disturbance from your friend"
            <br><br>"WOW! Sounds cool. I like you man, come on get me to her right away."
            <br>"Yeah sure sir, she's just a few blocks away from here"
            <br>"She must be fucking hot, waiting to get laid"<br><br> We kept staring at her house which was just a few blocks away.<br> "What are you waiting for let's go" - he said.<br><br>

            <em>Is this how's it gonna end. Would Shyla be OK with this? Would she be able to get over this? Fuck it! I gotta look after myself than Shyla, moreover we ain't husband and wife legally.</em><br><br>

        <div id="chapter 18">
            I kept thinking just for a while though and decided to let him have my wife. Maybe I should break up with her after this night or just be me like I used to be back then. This filth next to me was looking so awkward in every angle which I observed.
            <br><br> "So what would you do if she doesn't reside with your order to sleep with her?" - I questioned him.<br> "Douche first thing I would probably do is kick you out of the room and shut the fucking door. And the next thing is if she doesn't
            resides with my order or request then I am gonna use my method" - he said.<br> "Your method? Like what actually!"<br> "I would punch her in the face and make sure that she looses her consciousness and kick her in the stomach so that she remains
            stable, so that I can finish my business without any obviation from her side. That's how it's done. Bitch"
            <br><br>
            <em>What should I do now?</em>
            <br><br>"Is it like this sir?" - I said. He then turned towards me and I slammed his forehead with a wooden bat which I took from this assholes car.<br><br> At instant he was knocked out and dashed down to earth. I bent down to accost him
            and said -"How did you possibly hope that I would let you have my girlfriend"<br> "And for the record she is my wife you fucking filth you son of a bitch. I guess you don't even know who your father was. I am damn sure that your mom must be
            a hot bitch. And your father a sex maniac."<br> "I made a promise to my loving wife that I would never let anyone hurt her. And I am sure that if I leave a rapist like you without a proper concern, she might possibly be in danger. Maybe at
            some point of time I might not be there to save her from a mother fucker like you. I gotta take care of this mess right now." - I articulated which I held back for a long time ever since they ordered me to bring my wife.<br><br> He then dragged
            his body a little backwards from me with his elbow.<br> "Are you gonna kill me now? Please let me go, I am begging you. Please!"
            <br><br> Then I recoiled the bat till my back and hit him at his fucking mouth.
            <br>"You know what I decided to kill you and get the hell out of here and kiss my wife until she says 'I love you'." - I said with spontaneous deep breaths in between the confrontation.<br> This time he wasn't able to utter a word as I just
            broke his mouth. The blood was gushing out of his mouth fiercely. Then I kicked him at his abdominal region intensely with all the potential in me.
            <br><br> He rose up till his hips and screamed which would possibly wake up anyone near us. But luckily I locked this fucker's car so that they cant get out so easily.
            <br><br> I bowed down a bit to reach his face and then I held my thumb finger's on both of his eyes and I exerted an intense thrust to carve deep into his filthy eyes. The blood started to puke out a bit and he was screaming like hell. Then
            I cleaned both of my hands while he was still screaming like a dog who met with accident.
            <br><br> "See this is the other me. I am a bad guy but he only wakes up at appropriate disturbing times. Now he is out and would possibly depart anyone who get's in his way"<br><br> "You messed up with a psycho, and the reward for you is you
            gonna die a slow death which you never imagined."- I said with a fierce look at him.
            <br><br> Then I looked around for a tool or item to make this confrontation go interesting. I spotted an iron rod which was partly rusted and some small stones with a sharp edges. I picked up both and thought for a moment what to do.
            <br><br>
            <em>I know what to do now. Just go with the flow and see what just happens, just the way we experiment in chemistry labs.</em>
            <br><br> I removed his pants and underwear; placed the stone exactly at his opening. And pushed the sharp edged stone right through his abdominal opening. I can't describe it more as I am gonna leave it up to your imagination. And stroked
            the rusted rod through his other opening, you know what I am saying, Right?
            <br><br> And cut his balls with the knife which I got from his car. That should possibly make him survive with suffocation for atleast for a hour I hope so. Then I cracked his incisors and split his tongue. After that he was a lucky man to
            have multiple taste buds.
            <br><br>
            <em>I am done with him I hope. The rest of the pain is still left to him.</em>
            <br><br> The mistake which I committed was to leave other tools in the car, which the other asshole used to his advantage to get to me. While the other girl was still sedated in her sleep not knowing what's going on.
            <br><br> "Baaammmmm!" - sound of the broken wood bashed right through my forehead.
            <br>"You think you are smarter than my ass? Well face the fact you are a shit with underdeveloped brain." - the other asshole said to me with a half cracked wooden piece in his hand.
            <br>Lost my eye contact for a moment, blurred all of the sudden and a monophonic hizzing sound in my ears. He then kicked me with a recoiled leg in my chest.
            <br><br> Taking viscous breaths, was not even able to breathe. Wasn't able to expedite the intense kick with my breathing ability.
            <br><br> "Shit! How come you can be so violent towards this innocent guy?" - he questioned me.
            <br>"He maligned you to rape my girlfriend, is it a act of innocence my dear?" - I replied cleaning the blood path on my face.
            <br>"Fuck! Fuck! FuckKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!" - he yelled looking at the sky turning the other side of me.
            <br>I quickly rose up and stabbed a knife through his throat. The blood was pouring out like a coke bottle which has been shaken with intensely. That was the first time I ever saw blood from other's body gushing out fiercely.
            <br><br> Two down to earth, but deep inside me feels like I haven't let the other one die slowly and softly.
            <br>One left to take.
            <br><em>It's a girl, do I have to kill her too. Maybe I should let her go and make her regret in her tears.</em>
            <br><br> I made sure that all the car doors are tightly shut without a gasp of hole or any opening. She then woke up banging the window with her hands and crying to elicit the good guy in me. But you know it's the other me who possessed me
            for this moment of time.
            <br><br> Then I pulled out the petrol can from back of the car and splashed the entire car with it.<br> "Please let me live one more time." - she pleased me with a elusive look at me.
            <br>"I am actually giving you a chance to meet god and beg him for forgiveness to nullify all the sins you did" - I said.
            <br>"Please don't do it." - she yelled.
            <br><br> "I am really sorry, please forgive me for doing this to you. But try to be in my shoes and think. What would you do if you were me?" - I said to her with a duplicitous cry look in my face.<br> She didn't utter a word after that.<br><br>            "Be happy with her, and may god forgive you for this sin" - she said with a gaping look at me.
            <br><br>
            <em>She realized that she was a dearth to this world. May god forgive her too for her hackneyed sins. Am I committing a sin?</em>
            <br><em>I am damn cognizant enough to depart this people for trying to involve in an assault with my wife. Maybe they live a peaceful life in there next birth if god gives them a chance.</em>
            <br><br>
            <em>If you commit a crime make damn sure that you wont even leave a minute clue for the sniffer dogs to get to you. Obviate any clue from the crime scene or even try to plant some to mislead the investigators. Make it impossible to for anyone to get to you. </em>
            <br><br> I planted some clues though. Wiped my fingerprints which have been imprinted on the knife,car door. The car door was almost burnt, but to my safety I wiped it though. Removed my shoes and wiped my footprints; held my shoes in hands.
            Placed the knife in the hands of the other guy who almost tried to kill me. Circumspecting the situation and analyzed all possible outcomes which might get me behind bars.<br><br>
            <em>Is the car gonna get me in trouble? Not a problem, the car breaks down a lot which is a plus point for me.</em>
            <br><br> ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
            <br><br> Analyzed the situation for a couple of minutes. Everything depends on the answer's which I tell them if they ever figure it out.<br><br>
        </div>
        <div id="chapter 19">
            <i>I should probably get back to my car and bring it home to reduce my threat level.</i><br>Had a clear look at the crime scene which had been directed by me.<br>"I leave the rest to god" - said to myself.<br>Walked without shoes; I wore socks
            though and made sure that my footprints didn't get planted on the dusty soil. <br><br>

            <i>Wait a minute, those dogs can recognize the smell and expedite the cops towards me. That doesn't sound cool. What should I do now?</i><br><br> An idea flashed in my mind. Chili powder can deviate those dogs. I can't say how but all I know
            at this moment is that it ameliorates my situation of getting caught. I repressed a little backward in my mind. I could spot all the places where I started to walk and the fight and the car scene. <br><br> I trailed the chili powder where
            ever my presence has been before.<br><br><i></i>

            <i>Now the mission is completed. Let's hope for the best and prepare for the worst. Well that's a hackneyed saying.</i>

            <br><br>Started to walk back towards my car. After a couple of minutes I removed my socks and burnt it completely. I blew those ashes. I reached where I left my car in the middle of nowhere.

            <br><br><i>What should I probably say to shyla? Should I confess this incident with her? Will she be able to get over this and act like this never happened? Man I don't know what to do now? I am a murderer now. Once you chose violence it's gonna follow you forever.</i>

            <br><br>"I love you shyla, I had no option but to depart them forever." - I said gazing at the full moon.<br>"You had no option, really that's what you are gonna say to cops?" - a voice which I was very familiar uttered from behind. When I
            look back there she is with a enraged look at me. <br><br> "I couldn't even imagine you did this those innocent people. Stay back! Don't ever touch me again. I am gonna inform the cops now"<br><br> She started to unlock her phone.<br>I rapidly
            thrived towards her and pulled her phone away from her.<br>"Sorry baby not now." - I said to her. She had a astonished look at me.<br>Then I picked her up from ground and kept her in the back door. She tried her best to get rid of me.<br><br><i></i>

            <i>Does she really thinks that I turned out to be a vicious psychopath?.</i>

            <br><br>I tied her hands with the help of the mobile charger. She was screaming.

            <br>"Help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

            <br><br>I got my hands on the wheel and hit the gas and sped away to a abandoned place which I was familiar with.<br>"Sexy bitch standing by the road, looks like mothafuckin' slut yeah..<br>Working on all day, my dick's probably broke yeah.........
            I probably feel numb yeah, dont have an idea if my wife just found out yeah???? <br> Just wanna lossen up my pants... <br> And except to get my dick back yeah.. <br> My life's a fucking mess, dreamed of being' a fuckin' legend, yeah..." -
            the song came loud and clear from the car radio. <br><br> "Can you stop that fucking song?" - she yelled at me.<br>"Why? If I stop this thing, then probably you are gonna start your shit possibly"<br>"Huh! I should have never waved at you"<br>"You
            can't change the past baby"<br>"Don't baby me you fucking psychopath"<br><br><i></i>

            <i>My heart broke when she said those words to me. How am I ever gonna placate her.</i><br>

            <br>I didn't utter a word after that, I just kept listening to her. I guess woman dissipate all their agony through words. She kept on talking on and on and on....................................................................

            <br><br>I spotted my place and stopped by the lake. It's was a beautiful with moon light glittering by the lake. The trees, grass and almost everything makes anyone to stop by and enjoy the spot.

            <br><br>I picked her up from the car and made her stood. She insisted me to remove the cuff's which I tied her hands with a mobile charger. She then hit me in the nose. I remained aloof even-though she was hurting me very badly.<br>

            <br>Then she kicked me in stomach. It's was a powerful kick. I fell straight to ground.

            <br>"Guys like you shouldn't live" - she said looking for some potential object which can harm me.<br>I stood up with a lot of effort. She bashed my head with a rotten rod. I was bleeding this time heavily. She then picked up a heavy rock
            and came towards my head. Our eyes met deeply.<br><br><i></i>

            <i>I would be happy to die for her. I just wish god that she leads a happy life after this.</i> <br><br> She was stoned. She couldn't move a muscle. She put the rock away and was on her knees and sobbed placing her palm on my forehead.<br>"Darling
            why did you do this?"

            <br><br>"Just tell me one word that this ain't real." - my wife said looking at me shedding tears.

            <br><br>"This is not real" - I said back.<br>She then placed her head on my heart and cried even more ardently than before.<br>"Baby, I love you and I hope that you would forgive for not looking after you"- I said placing my hands over her
            shoulder.
            <br>"Comeon, let me help you out" - she said looking at me with a face of a cute girl, who cries for the first time when she lost her favorite doll.<br>She lifted me up and we sat together on a bench near the lake.<br><i></i>

            <br><i>Why did she kick me? What the hell is wrong with her? What the fuck?</i> <br><br> She was on a 'Saree', but a pink one. She looks adorable like a lost puppy in the new city. She was conveying the message 'Darling, please forgive me'
            and the other 'I love you' through her eyes I guess.<br><br><i></i>

            <i>Shit! how am I able to read her eyes? I should probably kiss her now.</i>

            <br><br>Then I landed my lips on her quickly without her permission. We did it for a long time, but you know the time is always the villain. She pushed me back gently. Her eyes were drenched with water still even after the kiss. She looked
            at me as if I got back to her after a war.<br>

            <br>"Darling! why did you do this?"<br>I turned my head side-wards, as I couldn't utter a word looking in her eyes.<br>"Baby! I had to do this. That's what bad guys do right?"

            <br><br>She then placed her palm over my face and turned my head back towards her.<br>"Say that looking in my eyes. I wouldn't believe that fabricated words."<br><i></i>

            <br><i>She is making me confess the truth.</i>

            <br><br>"Darling! I am not gonna make you stay behind the bars. I believe that my husband is not a type of person who kills people without a reason." - she said with a miserable look, who just wanna hear that I am not guilty. <br>

            <br>"Shyla, those psychopaths ordered me to offer you to them. What would you expect me to do?" - I said taking a deep breath.<br>"Darling! we could have gone to the cops"<br>"You don't get it shyla, those fuckers are not gonna change."<br>"Darling,
            I don't care about them all I care is you."<br>"Baby I am fine now, but you still don't understand why I had to do this?"<br><br> "Kumar just stop. Did you ever care about my feelings? Why don't you think from my perspective? Try to be in
            my shoes." <br><br> She cuddled around me and was crying. I didn't know what to do.<br><br> "Hey! Hey! look at me shyla. I am here in front of you"<br>"No! It's not okay. What would have happened to you if they had weapons."

            <br><br>"Baby, you are just worrying about me. What do you think would have happened to a girl who passed by them instead of me? Would you hope those assholes would have left that girl alone?"<br>

            <br>"Or else let me elaborate it in a other way. Even if they left the girl after assaulting her, as usual the cops would arrest them. But can you assure me that they are not gonna involve in this sexual assault on another innocent girl?"<br>

            <br>"Can you?" - I said with a high pitched voice.<br> She was stunned the way I confronted her. Her eyes were widened.

            <br><br>"Baby, it's not just about you and me. It's about all those innocent girls. Our country's rules are worthless, those ain't gonna change the mindset of those rapist's. <br> But today I just made a small effort by killing some of those
            bugs in our country. And I would do that again, if there's any girl who's in trouble because of assholes like these." - I said looking at her. <br><br> She came running towards me and hugged me tighter than ever before. I guess she clearly
            understood what I told.<br>"I feel very proud of my husband today. I love you." - she said with a sweet melancholy voice. <br><br> "I love you too shyla, and I promise you that I am never gonna leave you alone."
        </div>
        <div id="chapter 20">
            <strong>She insisted me that she would drive me back home. I nodded my head like a henpecked husband.</strong><br> She looks dazzling in that pink dress, never seen her that way. I mean she looks hot.<br>
            <em>She looks after me like her own son. And I treat her like my mom. Is this how a relationship between husband and wife ought to be?</em>
            <br><br> I rested my head on her shoulder. She remained aloof, guess she was more focused on driving me back home safely than to take part in romance at this moment.
            <br>"Baby why do care so much about me? I mean you are cute, have some inherited wealth...."<br> "I can answer that question. But let me say it this way, at some point in life you would get to know the answer. It would be more of a utopia
            thing for you when you figure it out."<br> "So you are not gonna answer it? Haa?"<br> "Of course that's a yes"<br> "OK! Let's see what happens"<br> "Yeah! Let's witness that moment together"
            <br><br>
            <em>I didn't understand any of those words. Is she trying to give me a surprise or I don't know. I guess I have to wait.</em>
            <br><br> It was almost 1:02 hrs and to my surprise my mom wasn't expecting me. I looked around after getting out of the car. "Don't be shocked darling. I told your mom something to lessen her tension." - she said placing her arms around my
            shoulder.
            <br> "Thank you my little girl. Now I owe you something"<br> "Like what darling?" - she said placing her lips over my neck.<br> I turned towards her and hugged her tighter and sobbed -"Baby please forgive me. I am really sorry that I lost
            presence of mind." - I knelled down and placed my arms over her hips with my head on them.<br><br> "Please forgive your husband and give him an another chance to prove" - she then interrupted me in between and pulled me up.<br> "Darling you
            don't need to prove anything to me. I know what you are and I also know your affectionate love towards me."<br> I was crying for the first time I guess. I was so pathetic about her this time. "Hey why you crying?"<br><br>

            <em>Am I really crying? I have changed completely. I never cried about anything before; although I was used to be angry about something which I don't know why?</em>
            <br><br> "Darling you are the best thing that has ever happened to me. And I can't see that amazing thing being teared apart. Now lighten up doll face." - She placed her head over my heart.
            <br><br> "You sound good. You, me and us from now on Darling!"
            <br> "I love you shyla. I feel like I am your beloved child."
            <br>"Darling! I am your wife and I am entitled to look after you. It's not a big deal sweetheart."<br><br>
            <em>Does every wife say these enchanting words to their husband's. I am afraid not.</em><br><br> It's too late now. I better sneak in before my mom finds out. It's time.
            <br>"Shyla"
            <br>"Haa"
            <br>"Baby I should get back to bed I guess."
            <br>"Okayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy....."
            <br>"So goodnight I guess."
            <br>"Yeah! I hope no other woman ever dares to come in your dreams except me."
            <br>"I hope not"
            <br><br>...........................
            <br><br> I climbed back to my room with the help of sewer pipe. I finally got back to my room with my expert sneaky skills. To my surprise.....
            <br>"Baby how did you get in here?"
            <br>"Just used the ladder"
            <br>"Oh my gosh!"<br> "Darling I got some first aid for your cuts"
            <br>"Now you are a Doctor haaa!"
            <br>"I would be anything for my beloved husband"
            <br><br>Then she lit the candle in my room and made me sit on the chair. I didn't notice anything which she was doing to cure my cuts.
            <br>"Ouch! That hurts baby"
            <br>"Then what were you expecting for. Of course it hurts"
            <br><br>
            <em>Candle light made the room look amazing as seen on movies. She looks gorgeous right now.</em>
            <br><br> I placed my hands over her shoulders. She didn't mind it and kept on doing the nursing thing. She smells incredible just like a perfume made out of sacred roses. I mean her body odor was impeccable.<br><br> "Shyla? Can I ask you one
            thing?"
            <br> "Sure"
            <br> "Do you wanna move with me to Canada?"
            <br>"Canada? Are you serious?"
            <br>"Yeah, I mean for studies"
            <br>"That's a long way. Let me think about it."
            <br><br> After a couple of minutes she was done with the first aid thing. Then she gave a mesmerizing look.
            <br><br><em>Not now, I am sick of this thing.</em>
            <br><br> "Baby I need to rest now. So can you..." - I said bluntly on her face.
            <em>Now she's gonna think that I used her.</em>
            <br><br> "Ok darling. Goodnight!"<br> "Yeah sweet dreams Shyla"
            <br> Then she left the same way she came. I was staring at her till she lit up the light in her room. She opened the curtains and waved me a goodnight thing. I smiled back at her and went back to bed.
            <br>
            <em>I feel sick of this relationship thing. I changed back to the usual way, the same way I was before.</em>
            <br><br> "I fucking hate this type of stuff" - I screamed to myself.
            <br><br>
            <em>I am left with 3 weeks to choose a college. I don't wanna die in this shit hole. I don't wanna live a normal life like everybody aspires for. Maybe this relation between me and shyla should end like this.</em>
            <br> See I told you I change spontaneously. I am not the one who takes the easy path. I stepped out of my bed and went straight to the mirror. My reflection was visible partly; the left side of me was visible due to the street light and some
            part of the moon light.
            <br>"Do you think you worth that girl or else let me say it other way around. Is she worth your time?"
            <br><br> "Dude after getting married, and after few days of fucking you are gonna feel dreadful of your life. You are gonna regret the choice you made to have this shitty part in your life."
            <br><br> "Look around you, all those reckless couples who got engaged for a better life. Do they look happy? Look at your own father who sacrificed all his dreams for you. Is he happy guy."
            <br><br> "Don't get into this horrid shit hole. You are gifted with some skills which can make you rich and have the life that you always dream't for. Take decisions wisely"
            <br><br> "Run for yourself instead of running for someone else. After all you gotta have self-satisfaction before you die." - I said to my reflection.
            <br><br>
            <em>Many people die way too early without fulfilling their dreams. Many people get with this family thing and forgo their ambition. But at some point in life they are gonna regret it.</em>
            <br><br>
            <em> They are gonna die an unaccomplished life full of utopia thing they always aimed for. I don't wanna be like those guys.</em>
            <br><br> Those last few words made a repression in my mind. I have seen my father regretting about something in his room. All I get is that he ain't happy about the choice he made. I have even seen him shedding tears slightly.
            <br><br> I don't wanna be a 2.0 of my father. I got a dream to chase and superfast flight called life to catch.
            <br> "I am sorry shyla." - I said to myself.
            <br><br>
            <em>I don't give a fuck about your girly feelings anymore. The only person whom I would die for is me. I don't want you to be a part of my life, where I would regret like my father in near future.</em>
            <br><br> I gave a right hook to my reflection. I aimed for it man. The romantic guy is dead and the bad guy swelled out like a maniac.<br><br>
            <em>Fuck your family shit it ain't gonna work no more douche.</em>
            <br><br> "Fuck it man! Shit!" - I yelled and jumped on the bed.
            <br><br> Why all of a sudden change in my perspectives? Am I gonna be like this forever.
            <br><br> Shit!!!!!!!!!
            <br><br>

        <div id="chapter 21">
            My character was juxtapose one. One was the bad guy and the other the worst guy who is easily irascible. I am tying to be good, but my hard cored perspectives are obviating those feelings. Maybe this is how I am programmed to. If my mind prospect any
            of these feelings, there seems to be a run time error.<br><br> "Wake up! up! up! up!" - my mom commanded me.<br>"Mom what now. Please don't try to be a martinet now" - I said to my mom with half open eye lids.<br><br> "What's wrong
            with your face?"<br>"Mom just don't ask about it. This is not the first time you caught be doing crazy things right?"<br>"I better have my eyes on you"<br>"All the best"<br>"Anyhow honey Happy birthday!"<br><br>

            <strong>Smash a birthday cake on the face, </strong><br><strong>It's my birthday, now you guys owe me a party</strong><br><strong>Spill some beer on your dress, baby, cheers to this I got my mouth to clean.... </strong>

            <strong>And you know I do care</strong><br><strong>It's my birthday!</strong> - I programmed a simple desktop application that runs in the background to play a birthday song.<br><br> My mom was not happy about the intense language used in
            the song.
            <br><br> "Thanks mom"<br>"So what's your plan?"<br>"Didn't figure it out yet"<br>"Just be ready. Ok?"<br>"Ok mom. Where's dad?"<br>"He headed to the airport this morning. It seems that he is transferred again to an another country."<br>"Ok
            mom"
            <br><br> I did my usual stuff and wore the new outfit my mom bought. It's strange that my mom didn't notice the broken mirror. Just looked at Shula's room for a moment. I couldn't see her anywhere in her room.
            <br><br>
            <em>I guess her heart gotta be broken today.</em>
            <br><br> A car with a lousy rap song came honing the way out and parked next to my house.
            <br><br> "Hey bastard come on let's go out and burn rubber." - My friend get out of the car and yelled at me.<br>He is my best friend I ever had. We used to do crazy shit since 10th grade. I hadn't seen him ever since graduating from high
            school. I mean it's just been like 2 months since I had seen him.
            <br> He was driving a fancy car. With a crazy horsepowered engine that I have ever seen this close.<br>I went to accost him in a our way. Many handshakes in a different way then finally with a kick at each other's ass. "Man that hurts like
            hell dude" - my best friend said to me after feeling the pain. Almost forget his name is Satish Siva kumar.
            <br><br>
            <em>It's like meeting old pal after a decade or so.</em>
            <br><br> "Happy birthday man. How are you douche?" - he said those words out of zeal of seeing his best friend.<br>"Better than ever. Where have you been all these days?" - I queried him with a wink in my face.<br>"What the fuck are you talking
            about dude? I requested you to come and spend these goddamn summer break with me and you said No! What have you been doing these days?" - he said looking at me like a convict widening his eyes.<br>"Man! I have been busy lately. I got completely
            into this Mr.Robot thing." - I replied.<br>
            <br> "Sounds cool! And I also heard from your mother that You have been hanging with some girl lately. Is that true?" - he came to allege me listening to my mom's words.<br>Then Shyla shows up and walks straight towards me.<br>"Hey! Kumar"
            - she yells.<br>My friend turns back towards her.<br>"She looks pretty. It kind of hits me strange." - he says in a low voice.<br>"What's strange?" - I questioned him.<br>"How come a pretty girl like her hanging with my friend who's a nerd?"
            - he said with a disparaging tone looking at her.<br>"Man I don't have any idea"<br>"Cool then get ready to hit the road loud and crazy."
            <br><br>
            <em>Should I tell those absurd speech that I prepared for breaking her heart.</em>
            <br><br> "Hey man quick. Get in the car" - my friend yelled.
            <br><br> Shyla came running towards me and hugged me. My friend was watching with a absurd look in his face. It has to be done now. She whispered "Happy Birthday darling".
            <br><br>
            <em>I don't want these little things anymore.</em><br>My friend was honking repeatedly. I pulled her hands away from me and walked straight towards the car without looking back towards her. I got in the car while Shyla was shocked with my
            sudden change in behavior.
            <br><br>
            <em>Let her think whatever she wants.</em>
            <br><br> Then we left leaving her in a dilemma.
            <br><br> ...........
            <br><br> We stopped by a Bar where a Hot girl was the waitress. We found a nice empty table which was clean. We ordered cool drinks with some food too. The waitress seems to make a strange gaze at us. As to my knowledge only guys above 21
            comes in here. Well we just ordered for non-alcoholic drinks.
            <br><br> "Dude what the fuck? Did you get married?"<br>"What no?"<br>"Don't fuck with me man. I see a wedding ring in one of your fingers."<br>"It ain't a wedding ring."<br>"My mom too has the same ring dude. I told you don't fuck with me."<br>"Man
            I thought of keeping it as a secret."<br>"But dude, whom did you get married to?"<br>"The girl who came towards me."<br>"That pretty girl, with gorgeous hair?"<br>"Yeah she's the one man."
            <br><br> Then he stared at me with jealously. I guess he liked her too. But she's my wife right? How am I gonna get rid of this conversation.
            <br><br> "Dude what college did you apply for?"<br>"I don't wanna conceal that with you. Let me keep it as a secret."<br>"Ok man"<br>"Dude you need to slow down."<br>"Me?"<br>"Yeah! You got married at 19. What next? Kids?"<br>"Ok! just stop."<br>"You
            need to live through this man. Look at you. Almost forgot your dreams. Ain't you?"<br>"Man I came to decision now. Let me deal with it, ok?"
            <br><br> I got up and started to walk out of the bar.
            <br><br> "Hey man. All the best with your life. I don't know when we are gonna see each other again. All the best man." - he said with a lousy voice looking at me with a affectionate face.<br>I went near him and gave him a brotherly hug.<br>"Dude
            we are best friends man. We can see each other whenever we want. I am gonna miss you buddy." - I said hugging him tightly.<br>"All the best man. Let me tell you one thing that girl is the best gift god has ever given you. Take care of her
            man." - he said.
            <br><br> I walked out of the bar. I went near the lake which was my favorite view in this town. I found my bench and sat there thinking about myself.<br><em>I love myself, not anyone anymore.</em>
            <br><br> I felt almost like crying. I placed both hands over my heart and snobed for a couple of minutes.
            <br><br> Then a touch I can feel which I was familiar with. She came again.<br>I got up with a angry look at her.<br>"What's wrong. Is everything alright?" - she said with a pretty look at me just trying to figure out what happened to me.
            <br><br> "No everything is not alright. After you came into my life I obviated all my dreams and permitted all the unnecessary stuff into me"<br>"What are you talking about?"<br>"I am talking about this shitty relationships. Look at those
            old people faces. Do they seem happy. They are gonna have a lot of unaccomplished wishes which they neglected because they got to look after their loved ones."
            <br><br> "What's wrong with you all of a sudden?"<br>"Look this has to end. I don't wanna live a life like my father or those old people."<br>"What are you talking about?"<br>"I don't wanna take these shitty responsibilities, like my father
            or those old people and forgo my ambitions and dreams that I always aspired for."<br>"Darling calm down. Ok?"<br>"I am not your husband anymore. I wish some nice guy would take my position?"
            <br><br> Then a strong slap in my face.<br><em>She is mad at me now.</em>
            <br><br> Then immediately she kissed me on my lips. It's was a hard one this time. Generally people have a dispute in situations like this.<br>She pushed me away from her.
            <br><br> "I was wrong about you. I should have never talked to you." - she said with a sob face at me.<br>"Well let's break those things now." - I said with a smile in my face.<br>"It's not that easy for me." - she yelled at me.<br>"Stop screaming,
            Ok? People are gonna think that I am assaulting you." - I said to calm her down.<br>"All you care about is just you. You don't know what feelings are? You don't understand your mother's love for you or your father's. You are an animal." -
            she yelled at me.
            <br><br> I got up. She had a angry look, eyes filled with angry tears.<br>"Shyla, I don't need this anymore. You got wealth and you are pretty. Any guy would like to fall in love with you. Why don't you just leave me alone."
            <br> Then she had something in her mind and started to walk straight towards me. She pulled the wedding ring from my finger. She even pulled out her's too.
            <br><br> "See this thing. They are the symbol of love."<br>"Huh! Huh!"<br>"You are not gonna understand it, but at some point you are gonna regret this."<br>"Shyla stop"<br>"You are gonna run breathing heavily for these rings. And you are
            gonna beg someone to be with you."<br>"What? Me?"<br>"Yes, it's you."<br>"Well let's find out."
            <br><br> She then stepped backwards and she threw those rings in the lake.<br><em>Is she crazy. It's their parent's wedding rings.</em>
            <br><br> "If you ever feel like coming back to me. Make sure that you come with these. GoodBye!!"<br><br> She then left running with a broken heart. Well I am not gonna come back for these.<br><em>Fuck them!!!</em>
            <br><br> After few weeks I got selected in a good college. The college was very far away from my home. I decided not to show up even in summer break. At the day of leaving my home I thought for a second to see shyla for the last moment.<br><br>            Well she showed up in the balcony. Our eyes connected for one last time. I didn't say a word.<br>It was a windy day and the sky was dark a bit with a mix of sun dawn. I really felt like dying.<br>"Dad? Thank you for everything."- I said looking
            at her to my dad.<br>"All the best my son. Now's the time where you gotta look for yourself." - my dad whispered hugging me tightly.
            <br> Tears started to roll out of my eyes. I can see deep inside her eyes too, begging me like a little child to buy her a doll. I was stoned.
            <br><br> There's my path to my dream life right next to me, while on the other side was the only person who loved me more than herself. It's a deal or no deal situation.
            <br><br>
            <em>Does every person on this planet get's accosted like this.</em>
            <br><br> "I am sorry shyla, I loved you more than anyone else in this world. Please forgive me for my bad behavior" - I said to myself and got in the car.
            <br>
            <em>She is gonna be alright. A nice guy is gonna take care of her.</em>
            <br><br> I kept staring at her till the taxi guy hit the gas. I couldn't describe those feelings. It was a pain in the ass. I thought of getting off from the taxi and run towards her to say that I was sorry.
            <br><br>
            <em>These are the points in life where you gotta break your own heart.</em>
            <br><br> I said to the taxi guy to go. She was still staring at me. I shouldn't tell this but I was crying deep inside more than her. I broke that innocent girl's heart. Now I have to live with this pain throughout my life.
            <br><br> It was 18:02 hours. For One last time I stared at her with a coded message in my eyes signaling a apology. I can see tears in her eyes. Then she ran toward her room without saying final goodbye's. She didn't come back again.
            <br><br>
            <em>I am sorry shyla. Please forgive me. </em>
            <br><br> I wiped those painful tears flowing out of my eyes. All I hope is that she should lead a happy life. I waved back at my parent's. Maybe someone should invent a medicine to forgo these painful memories.
            <br><br> ...............................................
            <br><br> After checking in at the airport, I saw a similar guy crying. But he was crying since he was about to leave his parents.

            <em>Maybe I should have invited my parent's too.</em>
            <br><br> After all the security check. I had a flight in two minutes.
            <br> I saw all those people waving at their beloved ones. I left for the flight and didn't think about anything else except me. I thought everyone has these painful memories and situations. I passed these things way too early than anyone else
            could. That's the love part of my life. After that day I just aimed for improving my skill set to make the best out of college and have the life that I always dreamed for.
            <br><br> My college life were like heyday's. I loved myself more and more. Professors started to appreciate me, while my friends entitled me as a nerd. While some guys who didn't liked me marked me as a jerk.

            <br><br>
        </div>
        <div id="chapter 22">

            Present moment, Date: 4 2027 "Hey are you even listening?" - I intruded him since he seemed like he completely lost his presence of mind.<br>"I couldn't believe in a thousand years that you both guys were in a love" - he said to me with a
            astonishing look in amusement.<br>"Even I couldn't believe myself that I fell in love with her subconsciously"- I confessed.<br><br> "Do you miss her?"<br>All of a sudden I became pensive. Tears were formed but I held them back stubbornly.<br>"You
            know what, I feel sorry for her that I wasn't the right type of husband for which she always dreamed of"<br>"Yes! You are a bad husband."<br>"Do you mean it?"<br>"Of course. But you have given your best which no one ever had. You crossed her
            expectations and dreams of her dream husband. Never regret like this ever again. You both were happy and you kept her happy till now." <br><br> Yes, I loved her more than anyone else could have. She treated me like her son while I treated
            her like my mom. I guess we had a passionate relationship.
            <br><br>"Thank you!" - I whispered.
            <br><br>I got up and walked towards the door. He intruded me and said - "I guess there's something with me which belongs to you". He then opened up a box which looked like a authentic one. He took a letter and a picture from it. I didn't look
            at anything which he handed over to me. I just walked out from there. <br><br> "Hey she always loved you till her death" - he shouted over the valley while I almost reached my car. <br><br> I turned around towards him and screamed -"Yeah!
            That's why she left me so early all alone to suffocate".<br>He didn't know what to say but after a few seconds he yelled -"No she didn't leave you man. She made you human and gave you rebirth."
            <br><br>What does he mean? "What I couldn't hear you."- I yelled back.<br>"You would get it somehow."- he said with a high voice and went back to his cottage. <br><br> I didn't want to run back to him and get what he meant, so I got in my
            car and stepped on the gas. The weather was nice, almost sunset. I kept driving not knowing when this journey's gonna come to an end.
            <br><br>Am I turning into a psychopath chasing after my dead wife's favorite places.
            <br><br>I can see a couple having a leisure walks by the hills. They remind me of myself and shyla. After looking at their faces I lost my presence of mind.
            <br><br>Shyla used to love long walks with me. She loved to cuddle her arms over one of my arms and place her head on my shoulder.
            <br><br>She didn't like me walking alone while I was with her. She used to take away anything which she felt like it those things could ruin her lovely walk with her husband.
            <br><br>She insisted to me that we should walk like a 3 miles and an another half mile up the hill to have a seat in the lonely bench. The walk was worth it. There was only one wooden bench up the hills. She loved to have a seat on it with
            me.
            <br><br>I can still remember every second of me and shyla having the last walk together. She stared at me as if who's gonna take care of her loving husband when she's gone. She took a nap in my arms when we last sat on that lonely bench. Maybe
            she wanted to feel my warmheartedness love for her when she felt like this is the last time with her husband. <br><br> She never took a nap before like that. Maybe she knew it was coming. <br><br> I can remember her last few words -"You should
            learn to live alone while I am gone. It's just gonna be for a while Darling. Promise me you wouldn't ruin the promise."
            <br><br>Maybe I should have taken many pictures of her. <br><br> While I was lost in my thoughts, a stupid girl came along the driving lane. Without a thinking I turned the steering spontaneously. Many people die like this for sake of saving
            someone's else's life; even though the fault was pedestrians. I was scared to death.
            <br><br>Did I run over her?
            <br><br>I looked in the side mirror. There was a girl who keeled down holding on to something. A sigh of relief after seeing her alive.<br>What the darn is wrong with her?
            <br><br>I got out of the car angrily and walked with a bad temper. I guess she didn't know what to do at that moment. She was still in the same position when I walked closer towards her. <br><br> "Are you out of your mind? Can't you just look
            around for a minute before running like a manic." - I shouted at her.<br>She then got back to her conscience and turned towards me. She looked at me just the way shyla used to. She then spread her hands in the air andi said -"Can you help
            me to stand up."<br>I gave her a hand.
            <br><br>I can feel my wife's warmness in her hand. Her touch is an exact replica of her.
            <br><br>She stood up at last with a puppy.
            <br><br>"So you risked your life to save this thing's" - I said looking at her in a disparaging way.<br>"Some live's are worth saving."<br>"Are you crazy."<br>"You can call me whatever you want."<br>
            <br>She even talks like my wife. <br><br> "Try not to die for some shit."<br>"Can I ask you one thing?"<br>"Yeah!"<br>"Why didn't you run over me, even-though you know that you are driving by the hills"<br>"Because I don't wanna kill an innocent
            girl."
            <br>"So do I"<br>"You what?"<br>"I Didn't want to see a innocent puppy die in front of my eyes"<br>"Whatever try not to get killed for a puppy."<br>"You too. Drive home safe, there might be someone who might be waiting for you." <br><br> Is
            she somehow related to shyla. Should I ask her? She doesn't seems to look like my wife. Shyla never mentioned me that she had a siblings. <br><br> She wished me to drive home safe with a cute smile. She is the person who welcomes happiness
            while I am a kind of dude who dies to get into trouble.<br>I got in my car. After just a few seconds when I looked in my side mirror that girl was shouting and waving her both hands.
            <br><br>I guess she was saying goodbye. I didn't care to look out of the window. I finally reached my home with lot of unanswered questions still rolling in my mind. <br><br> I made myself in the couch turned on the T.V and tried to chill
            out with a bottle of scotch in my hand. Kept on drinking until I tossed out completely.
            <br><br>"What's there not to love you" - I whispered. <br><br>

        </div>
        <div id="chapter 23">
            My sleep was intruded by the intense sunlight which was reflected by the mirrors directly on my face. Faced the usual hangover problems.<br><br> Ohhhhh! My head's gonna burst. A quick coffee's gonna fix this shit. <br><br> "Shyla, can you
            make me a cup of coffee of your style?" - I said rubbing my forehead with my both thumb fingers. No reply from her side till yet.<br>"Shyla where are you?"- I said with a quite a high voice. <br><br> I started to look around, something caught
            my vision. It's the framed picture of her hanged over the wall decorated with a garland and 'kumkuma'.(If you are a Hindu you know why?. Usually according to Hindu religious beliefs, the pictures of people who no longer exists are being decorated
            like this. <br><br> This is how Indian Hindu's show their respect for their beloved one's who departed from them. If you want to know more GOOGLE IT.) <br><br> I can't believe that my beloved wife is no more. She was the best in everything
            and now I got to look after myself. <br><br> I walked towards her hanging and kissed her face. I howled in agony when I realized the fact that my wife was dead a long ago. I turned my face towards her and let all those painful feelings and
            my insane wanting to hug her for the last time to emerge out of me completely. <br><br> Kept on sobbing till I was on the floor hugging myself to forgo the pain which was implanted deep in me after my wife's death.
            <br><br>"Shyla you were the best woman that I have ever seen. I always loved you and I still love you even though in your absence."<br>"Darling why didn't you leave me a daughter or a son to look after me so that I could have spent rest of
            my life with him imagining him/her as a replica of you."<br>"I love you shyla, and there's nothing more to say." - I said wiping the tears looking at my wife's picture hanging on the wall. <br><br> My wife was the crazy type and used to do
            the stuff way more differently than I did. We invested in a lot of stuff which we felt acumen enough for a guarantee return of our funds.
            <br><br>Some failure occurred though. But she was always there by my side, we pushed each other to move forward and welcome failure as it was an essence of life. She was far more intelligent than I was in business and managing stuff. She was
            the bad boss whom no one would like to mess with. I started to walk across our room which we built solely to portrait our accomplishments. She was the one who urged the interior designer to built it in her way. The room was decorated with
            all the pictures of our professional life.<br>It contained almost everything of me her and our business.
            <br><br>Spent a couple of minutes watching her greatest accomplishment, her marriage. She spent a lot of money to display our wedding picture in a bigger size than any other thing in that room. She loved to look at that one particular picture
            when she felt lonely or when we picked up a fight.
            <br><br>She even used to practice her speech, her attitude and her everything. If anyone asks me which was your wife's favorite spot? I would certainly point this room.
            <br><br>Now I am staring at this room all alone looking at my wife's cute little pictures, all showing affection towards me in some form.
            <br><br>"Shyla I couldn't be me anymore without you. I am lost."
            <br><br>"I couldn't even believe that you left me. Why didn't you tell me about your situation way before? Why didn't you let me know about you? What's wrong with me?" <br><br> "Darling please help me figure this out. I can't live without
            you. It seems like you and me are just one soul." - I confessed with lot's and lot's of tears which I couldn't hold back anymore and I was literally down to earth. <br><br> A picture fell from my shirt pocket when I bent down. With a face
            of kid who saw his parent's die in front of his eyes I looked at the picture which wasn't the picture I have ever seen. I immediately picked it up. A small elliptical drop falls on it.<br>
            <br>This was the picture which that guy from the mountain gave me.
            <br>It shows a empty road wanting a wear with full of big trees planted side by the road.<br>
            <br>Is it some kind of sign which shyla is depicting in this picture. What does she wanted me to do now? I have been roaming like a maniac for almost three days. I haven't slept for months. I guess my loving wife is somehow trying to connect
            the dots.
            <br><br>A loud ringtone intruded my focus on the picture. The call was from my business manager. He handles all my business stuff when I am too busy looking at other stuff. He tried to alleviate my pain when shyla was gone. He made me see
            psychologists, therapists and what not.
            <br><br>But all his efforts went abortive. Nothing was able to make me feel better. Some people are incorrigible, well I am one of them. "Hi sir!"<br>"Hey? How are you?"<br>"I am good"<br>"So what's up?"<br>"Sir let me get this straight. You
            have to show up in the office for a while. Things are getting way too out of my hands. A boss is required right now."<br><br> He never called me like this before. He just used to give me updates. Is there something wrong now? <br><br> "Hey
            Shawn I am moving out somewhere for a while to sort my head out. If there is an insane thing going over there then I would show up even before you. Understand?"<br>"Yes! Sir"<br>"Okay take care of yourself and your family."<br>"Thank you sir,
            for everything. You started to sound like you wife." <br><br> Am I sounding like Shyla? <br><br>

        </div>
        <div id="chapter 24">
            "OK shyla where should I go now?" - I said looking at my wife's picture.<br><br> I was fully packed and stuffed with useful stuff to keep me alive for months. I wanted to get out somewhere from this stranded situation that I am currently facing.
            This is a part of life though not the end of life. Once again I looked in that picture which I saw yesterday. <br><br> Had I been to this place before. Where's this place on earth.
            <br><br>Goggled it with keywords like 'lonely roads', 'quite road', '........' etc....<br>Couldn't find any similarities with the picture. Anger raised to peaks and I typed a bad keyword 'lonely fucking road' then to my amusement I found a
            picture and a blog with many similarities with the picture in my hand. <br>
            <br>"Ahhh! at last." <br><br> It seems to be a village very very far away from my place. I don't wanna say the name but I want to acknowledge it as a ghost town. The population seems to be deemed out. Nobody seems like to live in there. <br><br>            Why did shyla wanted me to go there?
            <br><br>Threw all my bags and stuff in the car and started the engine to embrace myself for a mysterious journey ahead of me.<br><br> "Love you shyla. I promise you that I would take care of myself." - I said looking at my house and stepped
            on the gas. <br><br> What to expect in this journey? And what not to expect? <br><br> I may have talked about shyla a lot till now or even more. From now on I am gonna think about myself like I did it when I met shyla before. My destination
            is way too far than I thought. Completely exhausted my energy on the ride. <br><br> Kept driving on and on and on and on<br> ........................................... <br> .............................................................................................................................................................................................
            <br>Driving is boring right? That's why I decided to flip. I mean to take a nap in a motel side by the highway. Spotted a just good looking motel. <br><br> While I was on my way to step in the motel I was accosted by a girl. She seems to expose
            most of her body parts. She wore a red dress exposing little bit of her boobs. I am not trying to say that she looked worse, she looked hot though but I am not the type of guy right now to comment on her attire. She caught my hand suddenly.
            <br><br> "Are you alone baby?" - She said with a deceiving look like a girl who tried to exchange sex for money.<br>"Yeah! I am. Do I know you?" - I said with a daunting look at her.<br>"You don't need to know a woman who trades happiness
            darling"
            <br>"Well I am not looking for happiness I am trying to witness a miracle."<br><br> Why don't she just leave me fucking alone.<br><br> "A miracle? Really?"<br>"Yeah! I am not in a mood right now. Please leave me alone."<br>"Ohh! Darling I
            can see pain in you. Just spend this night with me and I can assure you that you would sort your head out and be normal like you used to be before."
            <br><br>Is sex the only medicine for sadness. Am I gonna feel normal so that there won't be a runtime error in my mind and life.
            <br><br>I looked at her eyes. She sounded like a angel who came to cure my illness. I touched her fingers. They felt warm and wanting a loving touch.
            <br><br>She looked at me miserably when I touched her fingers. She seemed delighted. I guess many men just used her like a sex toy before.
            <br><br>I took her into the motel and kicked the door. I slammed her to the wall and kissed her forcibly. I held her over my waist while she cuddled her legs over my back. <br><br> I slid my head leftwards and rightwards for a span of time
            and we messed with both of our tongue's. She pushed me back with her hands a little away from her for her convince to tear my shirt. Then I unhooked everything which she wore. <br><br> She pushed me onto the bed and started to kiss all the
            way up from my shoulders. She came up with a look. Our eyes met. <br><br> I never done like this before with other woman. I rolled on top of her. It was the time where I gotta a decide to proceed further or not. The only problem is I ain't
            got no protection and she was a hooker. Well it was a bigger problem though. <br><br> "Darling I got what you need. I always have one in my purse every time." - She whispered kissing my shoulders.
            <br><br>This not what's gonna revive me from my pain. I am not this kind of guy.
            <br><br>I looked at her one more time. She is dying to have sex. I got up from the bed and turned away from her.
            <br><br>"Hey what's wrong. Due you need a chocolate flavor or a spotted one." - She said as I got up.<br>"What? No"<br>"Are you sure that you don't wanna get laid tonight?" <br><br> Why is she insisting me to fuck her? Is it how every hooker
            behaves? <br><br> "I don't wanna have this type of conversation anymore. Please leave now" - I muttered.<br>She then walked straight to me nakedly and said -"Doesn't matter give me my money."<br>Pulled out my purse and handed over it to her.
            She looked surprisingly amused.<br>"What happened to you? No men ever did like what you did?"<br>
            <br>Tears started to roll out and widening my mouth I howled - "I am so emotionally attached to her. You know I can't even imagine myself without her. A part of me had been snatched brutally by god."
            <br><br>She didn't know what to do and I guess she understood that It might be inappropriate to intimate anything about sex. She then immediately put on her loosened clothes and went for the door.
            <br><br>"I am sorry to intrude you" - she said turning her head a little bit towards me.<br>"It's okay, I had always been misunderstood by many. Even my wife never got what I really wanted." - I said looking at her miserably.
            <br><br>Something struck in her mind. She then closed the door and said looking at me with a slight of suspicion - "Just because your wife left you it doesn't mean that she misunderstood you." <br><br> "She died." - I intruded her in the middle
            of her conversation.<br>Woman's heart are fragile I thought as soon as I looked at her eyes.<br>"I am sorry for that I thought you just broke up with her."<br>"She never gave me a chance to break up things with her." <br><br> I guess I wouldn't
            have felt the same way if Shyla ever divorced me or left me suddenly without a note.
            <br><br>Still I couldn't control myself just like a kid crying for his most lovable doll.
            <br><br>"I should be probably leaving you now?"<br>"No stay. I changed my mind."<br>"Really?"<br>"Just crash with me for this night and I would give you a lift in the morning."<br>"You are such a generous guy whom I never ever met till now.
            You still love her right?"<br>"No I do not. Instead I owe her my life."<br>Then a long silence. She didn't get any of it.
            <br><br>Does sharing sorrows lighten us?
            <br><br>"I would like to hear your story. Are you OK with it?" - she said placing her hands over my shoulder.
            <br><br>I guess this is the time to see if I am gonna feel lightened or not? She made food for both of us. She enjoyed the food while I kept on talking garrulously. She was listening though, our story wasn't a conventional one which would
            sleep induce anyone who's listening it. <br><br> Does it?
            <br><br>

        </div>
        <div id="chapter 25">
            Sunday morning feels so light. Light filtering through the gap in those dirty curtains. Time's spinning too faster than before. The only change this time is I can see a sleeping next to me whom everyone probably call's her as a 'Hooker'.<br><br>            Single or not..<br>Good looking or not<br>Show's attitude or not<br>Smile's or not<br>Virgin or not<br>always respect a woman. ---- that's what shyla taught me. <br><br> She was ready for a move. I packed up my things again. <br><br> Am I
            being too romantic or idealistic to a foolish or impractical degree. I mean should I be so nice to a woman I barely knew who's profession is a aberrant from our fucking society point of view. <br> Fuck society? No, I do not mean it literally
            though. <br><br>
            <br><br>We didn't have a word for each other. I just kept on driving enjoying this lovely road with beautiful trees placed in a particular order.
            <br><br>Why did I never knew these kind of small things had such a beauty embedded in it? Well I guess I was caught up with my business thing.
            <br><br>"Pull over here. That's my house."- she said pointing her index finger towards her home. The house looked lavishly pretty good. I din't wanna question her anything even after considering her profession. I choose to remain aloof.<br>"You
            live here all alone?" - I asked her turning my head towards her.<br>"Where would you expect me to live?" - she said looking at me insensibly. I did not say a word which would hurt her feelings.<br>"No I didn't mean that way"<br>"It is the
            only family thing left with me. I am broke anyways trying too hard to protect it from snatcher's." <br><br> She is having a financial breakdown. How can I ever help her? <br><br> She got off the car and said -"Hey thank you! You can have your
            purse".
            <br>Why is she doing this? I don't get it?
            <br><br>She handed me the purse and smiled back at me broadly with a friendly face. I got off the car too and walked towards her and took my purse. She then started to walk towards her home. I intruded her and said with a loud voice -"Hey
            slow down a bit for me".<br>She looked back swirling her hair over her ears - "Did I miss anything in there?".<br>"Ahhhh? Yes. It's you."<br>"What?"<br>"Come over here. I got something valuable which might be a complete turn around for your
            life."
            <br>"Are you nuts man?"<br>"Just come over here cute girl."<br>She walked towards me with amusement. What was she expecting anyways?<br>I took out a visiting card and a credit card out of my purse and handed it over to her. <br><br> "Here's
            my visiting card and my credit card." - I muttered. She gazed at me with even more amusement and anxiety probably thinking why this crazy guy doing all these kinds of things for a girl whom he barely knew and spent an unglued night.
            <br><br> "Why are you being so nice to me? Do I owe you something?" - She questioned me desperately trying to wringer the reason behind my motive. Does this move by me makes her think that I am buying her out before anyone else does?<br>"No!!!!
            You do not owe me anything, Ok?"<br>"Then why you doing this?"<br>"I am offering you a chance to revive your life."<br>"Whose life? My life is already a mess."<br>"Don't worsen it more then."<br>She didn't get any of that, I hope? ..........
            She might be thinking that if I am retarded. Maybe I was ramifying my words. <br><br> "We are looking for a ironic woman who can effectively manage people and make them do what we want. I mean to placate people. Would you like to give it a
            shot?" - after listening my words she became a maudlin type of woman.
            <br><br>She opened the tap and muddled me saying -"God gave an other chance to full fill my life's purpose".
            <br><br>Why do girls normally cry over everything? Is this how they are born with this innate ability to persuade men to do what they usually want? Or is it the other way around?
            <br><br>"Look if you wanna change your looks so that you would not be humiliated by some of those men. You know what I mean right?" - I said looking at her dolefully right into her eyes placing my hands over her shoulder.<br>"Why aren't there
            handful of guys like you in this world?" - she questioned me back.<br>"Lady? I am not a good guy. I am the most worst guy you have ever seen." - I said with a gangster face.<br>Do I have to say those words? <br><br> "Well I guess that's how
            you fabricate yourself showing your bad side while the good guy's banging the door insanely to get out".<br>Am I pretending to show people that I am a bad guy?
            <br><br>She gave me a warmly hug repaying a small amount of gratitude towards me for what I did for her well being. I can see happiness in her eyes. She looked at me just the way Shyla stared at me when I cared for her well being.
            <br><br>She waved at me saying bye not goodbye. I was personified with joyful feeling all over my blood when she showed gratitude towards me.
            <br><br>"Drive home safe" - She yelled from a distance.<br>"I will, make sure that you call me back." - I yelled back at her burning fuel.<br>"I will. Thank you for everything......" - she yelled shedding happy tears.
            <br><br>I changed a girls life completely. From now that girl is gonna live happily. She is gonna get some respect from now. Maybe few men don't understand a woman's heart and their little feelings which they deserve. Maybe we are brought
            up in such a way to neglect their dreams, ambition , love ....etc....... Shyla would have been proud of me now.
            <br><br>"Shyla are you seeing this?" - I said looking at the sky through the rear view of my car. And suddenly the weather changed bit by bit and after a couple of minutes it was raining cats and dogs. I pulled by a river and some old guy
            noticed me trying to make myself for the night in the car and shouted -"Boy over here."
            <br><br>"What" - I got out of the car and yelled. By that time I was completely drenched by the rain. <br> Damn!!!!
            <br><br>"Come on. Quick!" - He yelled and gesticulated with his hands to come into his house.<br>Prospecting the area the old man didn't seem to be dangerous at all. Although it was a small home, just enough space for two people to live.
            <br><br>I quickly ran towards him. He warmly welcomed me home with generous smile.
            <br><br>He gave me a warm cup of tea. We talked for a while enjoying our tea. It was amazing talk which I had with him. He was a farmer who liked to live a peaceful life away from the distorting noises.
            <br><br>We prepared food together and there was a lot of laughter and happiness that I can feel. He sounded like a close friend to me. He was such a convivial person that no one would like to miss those joyful conversations. <br><br> He insisted
            me to sleep in the bed even though I said 'No'. That night was so remarkable. I ditched to sleep after having a generous heavy meal and his loving affection which he showed to a guy whom he just got to know. <br><br> There are many good people
            living among us. We just got to spot them instead of welcoming some bad eggs into our lives. <br><br>

        </div>
        <div id="chapter 26">
            The next day I woke up early in the morning. A good sleep which eventually ameliorated my messed up brain. When the time had come to leave he insisted me to stay for lunch. I conveyed him that I have embarked myself in this mysterious journey.<br><br>            Then without taking ages I told him the whole story in a sweet and short way.<br>Something struck him up when I pronounced 'Shyla'.<br>
            <br>"Are you sure son?" - he questioned me with a face widening his eyes and broadening his mouth and little bit of chin.<br>"About what?" - I asked him with a suspicious look.<br>"A name which you just mentioned"<br>"Do you mean my wife's
            name?"
            <br>"Yeah what's her name?"<br>"Shyla" - He looked at me more weirdly and I can even see a glimpse of smile in his face.<br><br> Why's everyone looking at me weird when I say my wife's name? <br><br> "Do you know her?"<br>"I wish. But she
            came here just like you, one night trying to find a place to sleep. That's when I saw her and told her to stay in my house."<br>"Did she tell about anything or like did she leave a message for me?"<br>"I guess not. But she requested me to
            hand you over a gift, in case you showed up in here."<br>"You have it with you now?"<br>"I have been carrying this in my backpack quite a long time."<br>I started to freak out when he opened his backpack. <br><br> What should I be<br>probably
            expecting from my wife now? <br><br> He took out a box wrapped with green cover. Unwrapping it leave me to an another jewelry box with soft touch outer coating. <br><br> "What's in it?" - I questioned the old man. He looked at me as if he
            was looking at his beloved wife. There was a sight of lost love which I saw in his eyes and I can still see it. <br><br> He paused for a while and uttered "You would know it. But she summoned you not to open it right away." <br><br> What's
            in it actually? <br><br> "Why?" - I questioned him narrowing my eye lids.<br>"I don't know. She told me to tell you that you should open it when both of your minds reunite." - he said.
            <br><br>"Who is both actually here now?" - I asked him looking at it.<br>"Well you got a long way to go. Hit me back when you found out what she probably meant." - He rejoiced saying those last few bemused words and started to walk away from
            me like a man who fulfilled his final mission.
            <br><br>I mean he walked away with a happy feeling raising his arms like a Olympian winner.
            <br><br>"Hey don't just walk away from me." - I said with a high pitch voice.<br>"What do you want me to do?" - He said turning his head a bit towards me and happily smiling at his best.
            <br><br>I felt happy when I looked at his adorable happy glance at me. I guess I still got more questions to sort out? And more clues every time I stop by.
            <br><br>For one last time I looked at the old man from my car. Shit!!! I forgot to ask his name.<br>"Hey what's your name?" - I shouted looking at him.<br>"Call me by your father name." - He said back. <br><br> This journey is getting more
            excited. I met a hooker and a old man by the name of my father and a small Pandora box. What's happening?
            <br><br>

        </div>
        <div id="chapter 27">
            Didn't get any of what that generous old guy incensed me with. One thing to say about this place is it's magical and I am completely drenched with delightfulness.<br><br> I have never been so happy ever since my adorable wife left me. She
            didn't left actually. <br><br> The scenery is bewitching me to take a look at it's immense natural beauties. People looked happy, I can see this overwhelming happiness in everyone's faces. <br><br> I guess many rich dude's came here to relinquish
            their old age dreams and delusions. I was fascinated when I saw a park. It had a walking track for early joggers and playground for kids and many more which many colony parks have. <br><br> Maybe I should take a walk. <br><br> I couldn't remember
            the last time when I took a walk in the park. As a couple, we always loved to spend some time together in a park. She always used to cuddle her hands over my arm and we both used to enjoy a enchanting walk.
            <br><br>I felt sad for a moment when I had a glimpse of me and Shyla enjoying our last walk to together.
            <br><br>I should try to get over this. That's the reason why I am here.
            <br><br>I pulled over the parking area and locked my car. I can see magic and happiness mixed in an obscure proportion in the air.
            <br><br>There's something good about this place that makes it insanely great. The parking lot was filled with luxury cars. My guess was right. Started to walk without guessing things anymore about other dudes.
            <br><br>This park is heavily funded by someone or many in case. It was aberrantly clean and had a ample of flowering plants and trees which were dwelling edible fruits.
            <br><br>After an hour of walking I was completely exhausted a bit. Couldn't find a board displaying 'drinking water'. I looked around and found a nerd typing seriously looking at his laptop. I thought of intruding him, but he was wired and
            was working on something with determination. Started to look for other people. <br><br> "Ahhh! finally there's a water sign board." - I said to myself to relinquish my thirsty. I ran towards the sign and started to drink water. Washed my face
            with a splash. Something caught one of my eyes.
            <br><br>A small girl is looking at her balloon which is in the middle of a speedway. She was about to run for it. I thrived running towards her before witnessing a disaster. The distance between me and her is like the end of the rainbow, where
            I wasn't even on the top of it.
            <br><br>I gotta save that little girl.
            <br><br>I raced towards her, while that little girl quiescently started walking towards that balloon. Keeping my breathing steady, I pushed harder and went faster towards her. Fear washes over me as I think of the possibility of saving that
            little girl. I said to myself -"I can save that little monster".
            <br><br>My lungs started to strain. My shoes pounded heavily across the ground causing mud to slash up my leg.
            <br><br>If you slow down, that girl's dead. By the time I reached that girl, she was in the middle of the speedway. And also a truck was nearing towards her, within seconds she would be found dead with body parts being scattered all over the
            place. <br><br> Spontaneously without thinking I dashed towards her. My luck was at peaks. I was alive somehow and was able to save the little girl too. When I saw her face she didn't know what to say. <br><br> "Hey, you can't just walk like
            that for a balloon. It's a speedway right?" - I said holding her shoulders. She looked at me as if she didn't know what might the consequences possibly be. She is five or six years old I guess.
            <br><br>"I am sorry" - She said glancing down with a sad face. She looks adorable, I feel like hugging her and playing with her all day. I wish Shyla left me with a baby girl atleast, so that I could see my wife in her.
            <br><br>Something started to prick me up in my mind when this girl looked at me.<br>........................................................................................ <br><br>I was stoned and started to remember the day when everything
            started to fall apart. It was a almost sunset and Silhouettes of birds flew home across a sky. The weather was apt for the situation. A little girl runs towards me carrying an unbearable sorrow. <br><br> I bent down to hug that sad little
            girl to let go her pain. When I look back at her she snivels saying - "Is my dad gonna come back and tell me my favorite story." <br><br> I couldn't describe that little girls pain for her father. She doesn't know what happens when people
            die. How to tell her that her father is not gonna come back to tell her bed time stories. It was more than a crying, she was completely drained of all hope.
            <br><br>I tried to soothe her saying -"Hey look what are you crying about? Dady is always with you, he didn't leave you.
            <br><br>Your father always used to tell me about his little princess."<br>She was still sobbing whatever I told made her grief worse.<br>"Hey look dady worked so hard to keep you away from his childhood nightmares. He loved you and cared about
            you a lot more than anything in this world. You were everything to him." - I said.<br>"He did?"<br>"Yeah!"<br>"Look Dady's with you in your prayers. Maybe one day this would all be just a nightmare"- I said to her. <br><br>..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................<br><br>            An intrusion from present scenario.<br>This cute little girl pushes me and says -"Sorry for not reading the red light poem when I am on the road".<br><br> Kids are funny aren't they?
            <br><br>"It's okay princess. But make sure that you don't repeat this again for a balloon."<br>"I promise" - she says with a wink at me.<br>I should probably ask her on a date.<br>"Where do you stay? Are you with your mother?" - I queried
            her.
            <br>"My mom told me not to disclose personal details with strangers." - She backfired me.<br>"Hmmmmm! You are an intelligent girl. Ok then bye!"<br>"Thanks for reminding me of the traffic rhyme."<br>"You are welcome."<br>"Do you read that
            poem aloud when you are trying to cross the road?"
            <br><br>Little girls are really awesome.
            <br><br>"Yeah you know sometimes, I try to catch up with the rhyme."<br>She laughs and says - "Do you want me to write it in a piece of paper?"<br>"I got it. Thanks anyways."- I said smiling looking at her adorable little face.<br>"Bye!!!"
            she waves at me and runs towards her mother. That's it.
            <br><br>Did I miss something? <br><br> When I walked back towards the park something started to bog me up. I lied down in the grass and started to look back at my past. There were a lot of things to share with you to lighten my grief. Would
            you like to hear it from me? <br><br>

        <div id="chapter 28">
            Everyone was too busy for formal introductions. That's how stuff works in big tech companies. I was stranded for like 22 minutes in the waiting room. That's when a blond girl approached me and escorted me to my desk. She showed me around and gave me some
            advice to stay alive in this place.<br><br> When we were in the lift she took out her makeup kit and started to smooch her face. She said - "One thing about this place, it's a lot of money and a lot of stress than your grandma
            can handle".<br><br> Does everyone around here have my ascent? "I can handle it."<br>"Let's see???" - she said and pressed the button. She didn't speak a word after that. <br><br> Well I guess they were trained to be laconic. Mine was 18th
            floor, the lift time was pretty fast though. When I stepped out of the escalator it was like a dream come true. I busted my ass for two years after college to get here. It was a hell of a ride though. <br><br> She walked faster and escorted
            me quickly to my desk. My workbench was insane, installed with three monitors placed adjacently and a high bass headphone to boost my focus on the screen. My colleague's workbench was 10 foot apart from mine so that we wouldn't waste our working
            hours in shitty small talk's. It was cool like a whole new world. <br><br> "Make yourself at home. Dude!" - she said.
            <br><br>"I will." - I said back looking at her gorgeous lips.<br>"Don't get caught watching porn." - she said looking at me dubiously.
            <br><br>What the hell? Is she insisting me to watch or not?
            <br><br>"What? Are you totally kidding me?" - I said shrinking my eyes a bit.<br>"Let go. I was just warning you man. Hmmm! You are such a douche." - she said winking at me.<br>"I think I should get to work right away."<br>"Yeah! you should
            or else you would be fired straightaway."<br>"Cool! Now you can leave. So go girl."<br>"You are too fast. Slow down kiddo." <br><br> Well that conversation went well and immediately after she walked away I turned on my computer. <br><br> "I
            love this place and I am insanely in love with this computer" - I said looking at my three beautiful monitors. I was wired and checked my email and noticed that the project manager assigned me a small role in his team. He mailed me the project
            details and specific requirements of the client. <br><br> I figured out what he needed and started to jot down the technologies and API's I would be using.
            <br><br>I made a map of all the things like how it's supposed to look and it's functionalities, prototypes ...etc on a white board. It was a keyboard, skills, logical thinking and a hell of your ass on the chair job.
            <br><br>It's my first project in here. I gotta prove myself.
            <br><br>The drinks were free in here. The floor had two fridge's for every ten people on the floor. There was even a masseuse employed in this office for every floor. I grabbed two Red bulls and drank a lot of coffee every day.
            <br><br>One of my colleague advised me to use some pills for improved focus.
            <br><br>His name was Paul. Every one called him 'terminator', because he can find a bug and fix it within minutes. We had this conversation about these pills during a lunch break.
            <br><br>"Man sometimes I am loosing my focus." - I confessed looking at the deadline date of my project. I was really sacred if I would loose this project.<br>"Why? What happened? You seem to do well in here." - he whispered placing his palm
            over my shoulder.<br>"Deadline is ahead. And I am still figuring out a way to work out on this API for money transactions and security thing." - I said looking at the deadline date abjectly.
            <br><br>"Want help?" - he said.<br>"Of course. You wanna help me with the code?"<br>"No? I am gonna help you out intactically."<br>"What do you mean?"<br>"I can see myself in you. I faced the same problem just like you do right now."<br>"So
            what did you do?"<br>"I found out that some of our highly paid employees and manager's are able to undergo a lot of stress using some kind of drugs."<br>"Drugs? No way?"<br>"Yes way buddy. They are legal."<br>"Legal drugs? What help are they
            gonna be?"<br>"Improved focus till the drugs gets insaturated."<br>"Man if this gonna help me then prescribe it to me man."<br>"They are named as Nootropic drugs. They are legal and help you improve your concentration or focus more."<br>"Do
            you use it?"<br>"Everyday"<br>"Cool"<br>That was the day when I started using those nootropic drugs. The results were exceptional. I written down an algorithm within two days. My focus was awe inspiring and I submitted the code one week before
            the deadline.
            <br><br>"Are you serious? This is the whole code?" - my project manager said looking at me skeptically. I guess he didn't except such a spontaneous quick work from me. <br><br> Well what was he expecting anyways?
            <br><br>"Yes!! Sir!" - I said adjusting my spectacles.<br>"You are really talented. I am expecting a lot from you. Give your best and we will reward you." - he said checking the code in his computer.
            <br><br>"I will never let you down sir."<br>"Don't call me sir, call me Harold."<br>"Ok?"<br>"Who knows very soon you might be the CEO of this company or buy this whole thing." <br><br> I felt so proud of myself when he was appreciating me
            and my talent. I was never appreciated by anyone when I worked for a company in my motherland. Instead everyone was waiting to see my downfall. They were trying to enjoy seeing me succumb to circumstances. <br><br> That's the reason why I
            worked so hard to come here abroad and work for a high pay. Everyone in my motherland who worked with me were so jealous of me when I got the offer letter to work for this company. Most of them didn't liked to see other people grow successfully,
            all they wanted was to see me fail disastrously.
            <br><br>"Those bastards and bitches are gonna cry now after seeing my salary figures which they can never even dream of." - I said to myself after hearing my salary number from my manager.<br>I was feeling happy and mad too. I though of calling
            them and whipping everyone off who disparaged me. But it's not what I am. <br><br> I am a cool and decent guy. Right? <br><br>
        </div>
        <div id="chapter 29">
            Time slipped really fast and I became a team lead within few years. My manager Harold became my best friend. Employees were resentful of me. I didn't know why?<br><br> He exactly had three cars, one which looked lavishly awesome and the other
            two were SUV'S. I can’t proclaim that he got what he wanted by just working as a manager for such a big company. Maybe he might have his decisive ways to earn extra income to have the life he always wanted.
            <br><br>I just can't keep this curiosity of mine keep tinkering all day long. I have been working under his leadership since three years. Time was slipping really fast. I turned 27.
            <br><br>Holy shit!! It's my birthday.
            <br><br>As usual my parent's wished me and transferred their blessings through hangouts. I hated to celebrate birthdays though. Harold called for me.<br>What's wrong now? Did my code did not make it through the testing phase? <br><br> As soon
            as I stepped into his cabin he said - "Look who's here, a genius who works too hard that he even forgets his very own birthday."<br>"I know that it's my birthday."<br>"Then throw a party tonight??"<br>"Sorry, I am not the party guy. You know
            me very well, Right?"
            <br><br>He then started to gaze at me as if he was looking at some crazy fucker. Am I a crazy fucker?
            <br><br>"Come on let's get out of this mess. I wanna party wild and let's get crazy+high together tonight." <br><br> "I am in the middle of writing an API for the E-Commerce website"<br>He is making a mad face at me now. Did I say something
            wrong?
            <br><br>"Don't be so workaholic. There won't be anything left with you except a pile of money and an big empty house and so..... Come out with me just for today. I will extend your deadline."<br>Why is he compelling me to hang out with him?
            <br><br>"Ok, but can you drop me back at my place after the party?"<br>"Of course dick. Why wouldn't I?"- he said with an uprising excitement after I nodded my head for his request. Well literally speaking he fucking ordered me. <br><br> One
            thing which I can say about Harold is he sometimes vilify the employees who work under him if he inspects anyone maligning anyone in his watch. <br>
            <br>"Now get the fuck out of here and go pack your shit really quick" - Harold said it deliberately. He is not just the one who uses this type of ascent, I guess anyone who works here inherit this kind of speaking skills. <br><br> After a
            few minutes he texted me to get down to the parking lot. Without any delay I grabbed my things and raced towards the lift, since it was about to close.
            <br><br>Fuck this damn thing!!! Parking lot felt empty as usual. Then a sudden flash of car right in my face, I couldn't see a damn thing. It started to approach me sluggishly. Then someone steps out of the car.
            <br><br>Damn! it's Harold. And an another new car. Where does all his money come from?
            <br><br>"How does it look?" - he questioned me with a grinning look on his face. He then placed his hands over the rear of the car.<br>"It looks sexy."<br>"Do you want it?"<br><br> Does he mean that would I like to drive it? <br><br> "Of course
            man, I can drive."<br>"Fuck you! I mean do you want it literally?" <br>
            <br>Why does he wanted me to have it? And that too for free. I think he devised some plan to get shit done from me? <br><br> "In exchange for what?"<br>"For sex." - he muttered.<br>"What? Are you out of your mind man?"<br>"Haaaa!!!! I was
            just fucking with you. You know that I like to have fun messing with people's brain."<br>Sometimes I don't get what he really means. <br><br> Then he looked around if there was anyone eavesdropping our conversation. "You are a quick learner
            and a diligent guy that I have ever met." - he said.<br>
            <br>"Harold, I really thank you for those words which you used to describe me but let's make this conversation a little succinct." <br><br> "This is what I fucking hate about you. Sometimes you gotta make people articulate their feelings and
            thoughts. Don't be so indecisive to listen to other's people conversation." - he said with a vilifying look at me. <br><br> "Ok, but for now let's cut the bull shit and get to the point."<br>"You are incorrigible."<br>"Thank you!"<br><br>            He threw me those gorgeous keys and gesticulated me to grab my hands on the wheels. The car was looking lavish. It was a Porche. I couldn't articulate my feelings when I stepped on the gas. All I could say is that It was fucking amazing. <br><br>            He insisted me to wear seat belt. Everything's seems to be alright. Maybe it's fine for now I guess.<br>A surprise gift from my Manager who is also a best friend of mine. I was finally in a verge of having the life I always wanted. <br><br>            I thought of calling my mom right away about this new car. <br><br> I write a letter to my parents every week. It was hard for me to articulate my love for my parents. So I sent them a gift box last year. Many of the products contained in
            it were iPad, iPhone ....etc.
            <br><br>They didn't like it though. But still I write letters to my mom especially.<br>It's a mom and son thing, too hard to say.
            <br><br>But I still don't get it why Harold gifted me this car.

        </div>
        <div id="chapter 30">
            "Dude look out!!!!"- he screamed changing the angle of the wheel. The fully loaded truck slipped by us of about an inch or cm.<br><br> It was a near death and the aftermath would have been a disaster which would have been scrolling in social
            media if Harold didn't do anything to mollify this shit. <br><br> "Are you a crazy Mother fucker? You little bastard, I told you to keep your eyes on the road. Fuck you bitch!" - he screeched. He used a really worse word which he usually doesn't.
            <br><br>"Shit! I am sorry man. I lost my presence of mind."<br>"You are such a bastard with shakky balls without gravity to held them afloat. Do you know what could have happened?" - he said with a weird enraged look at me.<br>"I am sorry
            man. I was swamped by my resentful memories."
            <br><br>"Are you out of your ball sucking fucking mind. Bend down on your knees and give me a lavishing blow job to soothe your fucking memories."
            <br><br>I stared at him and understood his concern for his life. I got out of the car so that our friendship thing between us doesn't gets worse. <br><br> I started to walk, the road felt empty for me. I really love this place and this country.
            This country is so peaceful which can be proclaimed by anyone once they depart from their motherland and move in here. <br><br> Clock ticked 6:22 pm and I can feel the magic in the air. The sun dusk, beautiful landscape, fresh water lake,
            people's happy faces, ......<br>What not to say more about Canada, it's like living your life to the fullest. According to me this country is the perfect milieu for anyone who wants’ to start or restart their life. <br><br> "Hey where you
            going? It's your car man, come back right now." - Harold shouted and mandated me to come back.<br>"Get out of the car. Let's take a walk." - I shouted back for him.<br>He quickly started to walk towards me.
            <br><br>When was the last time I took a walk and shared my happiness and sadness with a person whom I can surely trust?
            <br><br>"Dude! I am sorry for staying aloof while driving." - I said to break the ice.<br>"You should be. You almost got us killed." - he said bluntly at my face relinquishing his anger at me.<br>"OK! Let's not talk about this. And I convey
            my apologies for what happened."<br>"OK! fuck it!!! Let's talk about something else." <br><br> Should I ask him about the car thing? <br><br> "What's the deal with the car?" - I questioned him to lessen the tinkering thoughts in my mind which
            I can't be ambivalent about.<br>"What about it?"<br>"What?? You just gifted me such a nice car just like that?"<br>"Dude?? Give your balls some rest. What's there to hurry?"<br>"Man? I am just curious please don't let me die with this curiousness"<br>"Well
            that's fine. But don't blame me after saying it, you are the one who asked me in the first place."<br>"OK, I wouldn't blame you."<br><br> What is he got to say?
            <br><br>"I have been looking for an business acumen guy, who can promise me of astonishing results. Man I have working so hard to keep my business afloat. I busted my ass 24 hours a day to turn it into a successful business." - he said.
            <br><br>"Come to the point" - I said.<br>
            <br>"I want you to be a part of my business and look after it." - he confessed placing his both hands over my shoulder
            <br>.<br>"So this is the sole reason you have being soo nice to me?" - I said looking at his broadened eyes.
            <br><br>"What?? No. I am offering you an opportunity for lifetime. Why don't you get it?"<br>"Get what man? I thought you were my best friend. But now I realize what's this shit all about."<br>"What do you mean? I am your friend man!"<br>"Then
            why this?"<br>"Do you think that I am using you?"<br><br> "I hope so?" - as soon as I spit these words he pushed me with his bare hands. <br><br> Now he made a face which was hard to describe. <br><br> "Did you ever see the face of millionaire's
            or billionaire's? At their last moment they are not gonna regret like we guys do, they are gonna welcome death with a warm open hands. <br><br> Don't you wanna die with a smile on your face?" - he alleged me with intervening look which made
            me mortified with obscure feelings of my death. <br><br> Am I gonna die regretting the choices I have made? I feel like crying, Now!
            <br><br>My eyes started to drip with tears of hovering thoughts if my death would be a regretful one or a happy one. There is a fear inside my head which I can't live with. This fear as to be banished right away. I can feel the salty drops
            fall from my chin. <br><br> I can't stop this scene. I wanna cry like a lost 3 year old baby in a big cosmopolitan city. Maybe this crying medication gonna help.
            <br><br>"Cry! Cry harder. Let all the pain buried deep inside you be evaporated like a vapor." - he said with a concern for me and then he gave me a friendly hug.
            <br><br>I gotta decide. It's now or never<br><br> "So what's the plan?" - I said with a mixture of terror+anger+sad+fright look at him. <br><br>

        </div>
        <div id="chapter 31">
            There's a lot of bad shit going in this world, who are we to intervene. Let's just not get fuzzy but it's the truth. Let's just stay aloof.<br><br> "I need you as my co-CEO for my company. You don't have to quit your job though." - he said
            turning his head towards me. <br><br> We were having this conversation in the car. I felt like he was involving in some treacherous activity. But I was wrong. The company policies completely align with the Canadian governmental regulations
            and rules.
            <br><br>"I have to think about it" - I paused for a while and then said -"I am in this shit with you."
            <br><br>He now made an exciting face as he confirmed from me about his offer. He then pulled out some papers from his briefcase and said -"Let's make it legal then."
            <br><br>He handed me the legal documents and insisted me to carefully read it. I started to examine if there's any flaw in the agreement, I mean flaws that might get me in trouble. A sentence struck me. It says that I would be continuing as
            the CEO in case of death or resign of the current CEO.
            <br><br>"Man are you serious about this? CEO??"<br>"Why not? Who else would be so diligent enough to take care of my company stuff. Come on don't think about it all day long, I haven't got the time. Just put your damn sign on it." <br><br>            I took a pen from my pocket and filled the empty gap with my signature. I was nervous enough to <br><br>take the right choice. "Welcome aboard to take care of my shit!" - he said with a firm handshake and with that vicious eye at me. But the
            things are subtle now, as I was prescient about the company's profile and a lot of fucking <br><br>things about this crazy fucker. "We need to get high man!!!!!!!"<br>"I am already high"<br>"I mean literally we need to get high"<br>"OK! Let's
            stop by a nearby bar. I guess there's one, not too far I hope." <br><br> "NO NO............ Not that shit again. Let's try other stuff. Which can really kick us up."<br>"Like what?"<br>"Drugs%%%%%%%%%" - he said breaking the ice in our conversation.
            <br><br> Drugs! No way. Is he completely out of his rotten mind. <br><br> "No way that we are doing drugs. I don't wanna get busted by Mounties and deported back to my country." - I said it clearly to get this shit in his brain. <br><br> "You
            are Canadian citizen now." - he tried to persuade me to have drugs saying it in an oblique way that it's normal to do drugs.<br><br> "No fucking way I am doing that shit. I love your country and I want to abide by the rules. Like a responsible
            citizen of your country." - I said it straight cutting all the bull shit. <br><br> He then made a look at me which made me felt so obfuscated with obscure feelings about myself. <br><br> I shouldn't have articulated the responsible word<br><br>            "Alright then. Let's go to my friends place." - he said.<br>"Where and who is it?"<br>"It's a she. Don't worry she is really hot and it takes to be a real man to be around her presence." - he said intimating something about her body curves,
            looks and some of unconventional girl stuff's which weren't supposed to be articulated. <br><br> "Can you please stop it. OK I get that she is hot, so what Now? What do we probably gonna achieve talking about the way she looks. What is it
            for me?? Haaaaa??" - I said it in a narcissistic way. <br><br> I have already said to you guys that I shower intense affection and love towards myself. Sometimes, I fell like hugging myself and be like this forever. <br><br> "OK, let's cut
            the bullshit and can you fucking drive this bad bitch. It's really getting fucking late and the other thing is I really need to take a bad shit, so can you drive Mo*** fucker." - he used words which he didn't meant it literally though. <br><br>            I stepped on the gas and thrifted quickly to 90 miles/hour in 12 seconds. Phew, that was ostentatiously fucking cool.
            <br><br>Then he started recording this piece of shit. Harold usually uploads videos in his bad American ascent; I felt like he was literally disgracing himself.
            <br><br>"Hey all motherfuckers. How's it going. I got laid pretty badly which eventually got me an appointment to a sex doctor. OK so what's this piece of shit is all about?
            <br><br>This Mo**** fucker over here is my best friend. And today is the day when he popped out. I feel so awful to articulate further. So I decided to surprise this little slut with some drugs. He rejected though. So I am gonna fucking take
            him to a place where you can get blissful of sexual arousal satisfaction." - he said videotaping both of us in the car while I was driving. <br><br> Sexual satisfaction?? Where is he taking me??? <br><br> "Fucking stop this mother fucking
            car already. We just arrived here. Come on, get out of the car." - he screamed which scared me to death. <br><br> "What did you mean by satisfaction? Where are we? Are you fucking with me man?"<br>"All your queries about the video piece of
            shit is right here." <br><br> What is he trying to do with my already fucked up life? <br><br> "Get your ass in here. Right now! Fucker" - he yelled and mandated me to get out of the car.
            <br><br>

            The house seemed big enough for a crowd to sneak in and get along with these party monsters. It seemed to me like most of the people doesn't know each other or mostly anonymous people just get in when someone announces the words 'Party in my home'.<br><br>            Harold was high already. He took MDMA pills and he even insisted me to have some. I declined his offer for me which is the ticket to the amazing zing-zing world where you are an insane person all of a sudden. <br><br> "Come on man! This is
            the day when you popped out. And you should probably be celebrating and apart from that you are my Co-CEO. Just forget about everything today and enjoy the insane magic in the air." - Harold said it with some gesticulations. Probably he might
            be imagining himself as a Rapper or a High dude stuff thing. <br><br> "Are they addictive man?" - I questioned him after thinking for a couple of seconds. Maybe I should try them. These people seemed to be more happy than ever. Fuck it, it's
            just for one night. What harm would they be? <br><br> "Well I can't say that. Because I take MDMA occasionally. It's been like 3 years since I last took it. Don't worry about it." - Harold said.<br>"So it's addictive right?" - I alleged him
            with preying eyes.<br>"OK fuck it. If you don't wanna do drugs than don't do it. Have a few drinks and get buzzed up. Now go enjoy this moment." - Harold said with a confronting look at me. The music was pretty hard and I couldn't hear anything
            else but lyrics lyrics lyrics........... <br><br> Sluts all around in here, it's too hard to keep my feelings aloof in heee. <br> Now everyone wants to pull me down because I am really high up yeah... <br> Got it working all day long like
            a hoe... And used my name screamed in a intercourse loud.... <br><br> We walked straight to the table where all the bottles were organized neatly. He picked up some fancy bottle and leaned towards my right ear and started to speak in a high
            pitched voice - "You know what this shit which I am holding costs your one month salary. This is fancy shit man!! Have it!" <br><br> He said and handed me the bottle and a fancy looking glass. I knew he was trying to play some games with me.
            But I couldn't figure it out what was his real motive behind this bottle stuff. He poured me some wine decisively and made me drink forcefully. <br><br> "Powwow! That just felt like horse shit. What is in this thing man. Did you adulterate
            this shit with your piss?" - I said. I literally felt awe full as soon as I gulped the costly fancy wine shit into me.<br>"How do you feel now! Are you feeling like a messed up fucker right now?"<br>"Yeah! What did you do to me man?"<br>"I
            adroitly mixed some MDMA pills. Don't worry it's not gonna harm you or gonna make you a drug addict." <br><br> Is he messing with me right now. I told him not to put this shit into me. I knew this was gonna happen. <br><br> The house now seemed
            a way too different to me right now than before. I guess the drugs started to kick out. <br><br> Fancy girls, fancy shit(yeah, yeah)<br>I wanna be a crazy mother fucker tonight (tonight, tonight)<br>Chunk the beer, harder...harder (yeah, yeah...........yeah)<br>No
            offense, its my day (day,day,day)
            <br><br>"Now go and enjoy. Show these people what you got." <br><br> The song really felt good to me this time. I started to show the best out of me to these people around who were dancing like maniacs. I was dancing like shit too without
            any shame.
            <br><br>I guess that's what happens when you are high. The dance floor was completely filled with different kind of shoes, sexy legs and what not to expect in a nice party. The music was as loud as thunder, it made the keys on the tabletops
            shake invariably like a angry rattle snake who has made its target on its prey. Neon lights flashed everywhere like police sirens just like in movies. <br><br> Get laid, Get hooked, Get<br> caught........................................up<br>            You are the one, you are the fun. <br> Just chill upppp. <br> Hit the gas and park next to a side chick....... <br><br> Spot a place where there's no one to watch it.. Three there go there shake the car off. <br><br> The song that was playing
            got fucking louder which would eventually blow my ears off. I had no fucking choice but to join the jumping and bashing crowd. I felt like my body was getting ripped off. <br><br> After an hour or so a girl pulled me out of the crowd and whispered
            in my ears - "I want to feel you deep inside me. Let's have this pillow talk together right now upstairs." <br><br> What's going on. I am literally losing my senses which knocked down my conscience to tell me what to do. <br><br> She was wearing
            a red dress and skirt. She dragged me all along those stairs. And opened the door to unhook unfulfilled desires. She then pushed me towards the bed and laid her leg over me. <br><br> What's happening to me?????????????
            <br><br>She then started to strip her clothes off. She was naked in just a few seconds, guess she wasn't laid for a quite long time. She then fell on me. I could feel the warmness of her body lying over me. <br><br> A mouth interference with
            tongue's exchanging fluids. I wasn't on my senses. I couldn't get the nerve to let go this thing. <br><br> She then kept her hands on my zip. She pulled it down spontaneously. Then the cow girl style which she came up with. I was busted by
            this sexy looking girl.<br>I can actually feel deep inside her now. <br><br> What am I doing?? <br><br> "Please get off me. Please!!!!" - I cried.<br>"What's wrong?" - she alleged.<br>"Can you please get off me. Please leave me alone."<br>"No
            I had not been laid for a long time. Now I want you to burst inside me."<br>"No fucking way that's happening." - that was the time when I got back to my senses. I pushed her side-wards without hurting myself and got off the bed. <br><br> "Are
            you for real man? What's wrong with you?" - she confronted with intervening look at me.<br>"Look I don't wanna cheat anyone"<br>"Cheating? Who? You and I are not married."<br>"No I feel like I am cheating someone else whom I can't even remember."<br>"You
            are being loyal to a person which you can't even picturized of."<br>"Yes I am. I am being loyal to myself. Now can please let me go." <br><br> She then freezed for a while with a naked pose not knowing probably what to say to wrench me off.
            Then came the F Bomb - "Fuck off you bastard."<br>I said "Thank you!" and got out of the room and took a deep breath; a sign of relief. To my notice the crowd stopped jumping. <br><br> "Hey!!! Who turned off those cool songs." - I screamed
            gazing the crowd. <br><br> No one cared to answer me back. The crowd which were acting out of control started to form a circular pattern looking at someone so seriously. <br><br> I guess people took this drug thing too far. Possibly some insane
            dude and a girl are banging each other. Shit! I can't wait anymore to watch them having sexual intercourse in public. <br><br> I thrived down the stairs and swapped through the crowd like a professional swimmer to watch it more clearly. What??
            This can't be happening! <br><br> Harold was lying down cuddling arms around his stomach and spitting blood out of his mouth. I was stoned and I couldn't literally move a muscle after watching him like that. The whole crowd looked amused,
            probably they didn't even know how to react. <br><br> He was rattling the carpet like a little puppy which met with an accident. Just like those innocent animals which couldn't articulate their pain in a wordily way, Harold was in the same
            circumstances too. I bent down to him and picked him up in my arms. <br><br> "What the fuck are you guys staring at? Can't you see that a person is in trouble?" - I yelled gazing the crowd around me. What's wrong with him? What can be done
            to subtle his condition. <br><br> "You guys fucking move the way out!" - I screamed. <br><br> (){}[]
            <br><br> I drove as fast I could to quickly get him to an emergency ward. Eventually I parked the car in the lawn of the hospital. I took him out of the car and screamed - "Help!!! Somebody get the emergency bed." <br><br> The staff quickly
            got to me and we were raced towards the emergency ward. Suddenly I felt a electric sparkle over my fingers. Harold looked at me with half eye open and somehow he was able to gesticulate me to come closer. <br><br> I can't lose him, he is the
            one who mentored me. <br><br> We reached the emergency ward and nurses obviated me from entering in. I was terrified to death. I prayed to god to save him. He got a daughter and wife, who might be probably expecting him at home. <br><br> Now
            who's gonna play with his daughter like he does, who's gonna show passionate love and caring towards his wife like he does. Who's gonna do what he really does. <br><br> All these thoughts of the future without him being around for those he
            cared dragged me into a horrid rapid hole full of visuals of woman crying, children staring and asking elders questions like 'why their parents are sleeping in a container', some other people making financial statements and ...... I couldn't
            say it. <br><br> Eyes turned red, and I began to think what would happen if I die too. <br><br> 'When a person dies, he doesn't leave alone. He/she untangles all these emotional-caring-love-respect-security with everyone who admired him or
            loved him.'<br><br> How is his wife and his little daughter gonna feel the armor which he provided to keep them safe; no matter what the circumstances where. His daughter was everything to him, apart from his career. <br><br> He used to say
            to me "You know what Kumar the most amazing experience which I ever had was holding my daughter for the very first time. Touching her little fingers and watching her eyes blink amused me a lot. I just kept watching her each and every action
            the whole day. I just felt like god gave me my mom back." <br><br> "The truth is I was literally scared to hold my daughter for the first time, because I didn't know that anything could be so small and so delicate. That was the moment when
            I decided to be there for my daughter every important fragment of her life. To always be there whenever she falls and to give her a warm hug and tell bedtime stories in case if she has a bad dream." <br><br> Is this what people term as 'love'.
            <br><br> Intrusion "Are you the guy who got him here?" - questions the doctor acquiescently placing his hands over my shoulder.<br>"Yes?"- came the silent pitched word out of my mouth.<br>"How long has he been using drugs?" <br><br> "I didn't
            knew that he uses drugs till now. What's the matter? Is he gonna be okay?" - I said with intervening deep breaths for every word that I try to articulate. I was panting when the doctor questioned me about the drugs thing. <br><br> Doctor shifts
            his focus on the reports that were just generated. And makes a tacit look at me. I can't be having this kind of conversation. <br><br> Then he breaks the ice saying -"Look the report says that apart from taking MDMA, he injected himself with
            some poisonous substances in an innumerate quantity. That got him to point where he didn't leave us any options." <br><br> "What are you trying to say? Get this shit straight." - I said raising my voice. Grabbing his collar made him angry
            and the hospital staff who were around started to whack out. A nurse requested me to leave him. Then came the security guys and pulled me away from him. <br><br> But still I was like a tiger in a trapped cage trying to figure out a way to
            get out of this shithole. <br><br> "Look, he planned it so carefully that it is almost impossible to look for options now. He willfully wanted to die more than he wanted to live his life. That's what he wanted, now go and pay your last homage.
            He just got a couple of minutes left." - The Doctor confessed throwing the reports at my face. <br><br> Few more minutes, couldn't he be any meaner. <br><br> I felt like I was falling apart. All the pain inside me got amplified wider. The
            fact that I can't call his wife neither. <br><br> Calm down! Calm down! <br><br> I snitched to the wall and started to weep like a puppy who lost one of his brother. <br><br> Why people kill themselves? Is it how they think the world works?.

        <div id="chapter 33">
            Breathing heavily, swiping my face with my bare hands, taking steps consciously approaching the emergency door. Everything felt like a maze with no sign pointing a way out.<br><br> Machines sounds is all that I can hear from all corners of
            the room. These hostile feelings started to strand me and started to drag me to a horrid hole leading to a place where there's always sorrow, weep, cry, hard-feelings, death, loss........<br>I can't take this anymore. It's too much to take
            in. <br><br> (){};"'%$~+
            <br><br> Harold held his hands up in the air wanting a touch. I sat next to him. He could barely open his eyes. I leaned forward as he was about to whisper - "Dude, I am sorry." <br><br> What is he sorry for? <br><br> "Harold I am the one
            who should be apologizing for not getting you to the hospital on time. I should have never .. " - Harold interrupted me by pressing my fingers. <br><br> "It's not your fault. I did it willfully."<br>"What? What's that supposed to mean?"<br>"Dude
            I have always tried to be the person whom I always admired to be. But it has always been a fantasy. It was like I was after something which I could barely see."<br>"Harold you are more than you think you are. You did the best. You were the
            best."
            <br>"It's not about being best, it's about being the best. It's too late now to explain."<br>"Just tell me why did you do this? Did someone did this to you wantedly?"<br>"There's no one to blame for. It's just me."<br>"Harold you got a little
            daughter who might be waiting to hear your bedtime stories." - as soon as I spelled the word 'daughter' the machine spontaneously started to produce a beep sound. All I can see is straight lines. <br><br> I couldn't feel what I felt a couple
            of minutes before in Harold's hand. <br>
            <br>I placed my forehead on his hand and sobbed - "Dude I am sorry". After a span of time, I realized that his wife has to be informed about this. <br><br> How can I ever literally shatter their happiness by a phone call. Walked towards the
            parking lot and searched for Harold's phone in the car, picked it up and typed some keywords to get his wife's number. To his instinct he saved his wife's number by the name 'bad girl'. <br><br> "Hello, can I talk to April?" - I requested
            to a voice which kind of sounded like Harold's daughter.<br>"Can I know who is on the other side of the phone?"<br>"Uhhhhhh! It's your dad's best friend."<br>"NO! You are lying. My dad told be that I was the only friend he ever had."<br>"Dear
            it's not like that. We kinda work together and that kind of stuff. So can I talk to your mom?"<br>"Mom...."- the little girl said it with a loud voice.<br>"Who is it little bear?" - little girl's mom question her.<br>"The guy from the other
            side says that he is dad's best friend." - the little girl said.<br>"Let me check it out and don't forgot to brush your teeth dear." - little girl's mom intimated her.<br>"Hello, can I know whom am I speaking to?" - Harold's wife questioned
            me.
            <br>"It's Kumar.... me and Harold work together in the same office."<br>"Is there any messages for me from Harold."<br><br>How can I say that his husband is dead. <br><br> "Yeah he is aaa....." - I juggled my thoughts since I couldn't possibly
            articulate the incident to her. <br><br> "Is it gonna be late night work at office?"<br>"No. Something bad happened to him." - I wiped the tears while I was on the phone.<br>"Bad? What happened?"<br>"Mam, Harold took some stuff which led him
            here. And the doctor's says that he's not gonna be Okay."<br>"What? Where is Harold? Doctor's?" - Harold's wife screamed.<br>"Mam, I can't say what happened to Harold. Can you come here real quick?" <br><br> "Please tell me that he is okay?
            Please?" - she cried.<br>"Mam, I am sorry to say this but he is not okay. Doctor's says that he wont hold up too long." - I finally articulated the total situation to her which was about a couple of minutes ago.<br>"He can't....." - she said
            and I could here a thud sound, probably she might have lost her consciousness and fallen down.<br>"Mommy why are you lying down?" - I could here Harold's daughter doing the talking again but not with me, it's with her mother. That's when I
            realized that she fainted after hearing my succumbing words. <br><br> "Mommy Mommy M..................." - Harold's daughter kept on shouting but there was no one there to wake her mom. <br><br> ()#$%!@#
            <br><br> An ambulance was on the way to Harold's home for medical emergency. I kept staring at the sky to let go this sorrow. I thought of calling my mom for a second. <br><br> But I couldn't share these kind of things with her, she's too
            sensitive in this kind of matters. I could hear ambulance siren yelling to shove its path to the hospital. I wasn't being normal ever since I saw Harold bleeding to death and listening to his last few words that he held up for me. <br><br>            The ambulance driver rushed in front of the main entry and the nursing staff quickly got there and gave a hand in helping the emergency bed to land on the ground. They swiftly took the lady laying on the bed inside. <br><br> Is she April?
            <br><br> Thought of asking the driver from where did he just came from, but I remained aloof. I could see a little girl trying to get down from the ambulance vehicle. Those ambulance guys might have just ignored or forgotten about the girl.
            I walked towards the back of the ambulance. It's her. Harold's very own daughter. <br><br> This little girl had the exact same eyes just like his father had. I picked her up in my arms and asked - "What's your name little bird?" <br><br> "It's
            Ellie." - she said looking at me.<br>"Is she your mother?" - I asked holding my hands tighter together so that she would comfortably sit over my hands.<br>"She is my mom and my big teddy bear too." - she said blinking her cute little eyes.<br>"Can
            I see my dad?" - she requested.<br><br>Can this innocent little girl see his father like that? Maybe it's okay to show and remain aloof. <br>"Yeah! let's go and see your dad." <br><br> I have shown her father through a little round unclouded
            part of the door. She was too little to understand what's really going on and I too didn't have temerity to say her. "Can we go inside and wake my dad up?" - she questioned.<br>"Why dear?" - I asked her with a doubtful look at her.<br>"My
            father never goes to sleep without telling me bedtime stories." <br><br> Maybe it's gonna be okay to take her inside and show her last affection towards her beloved dad. <br><br> I walked her inside the ICU with me. She ran towards her father
            and grabbed his hands. "Daddy you broke the promise. You said you would never go to sleep without narrating me a fairly tale. Now you have to buy me an ice cream." <br><br> "Look dear, daddy is not sleeping." -I said bending my knees down
            and placing my hands over her arm.<br>"Then why is he not responding to my words?"<br>"Dear, what if I buy a big ice cream? Would you like to come with me to the ice cream shop?"<br>"No. I only go with people whom I surely know."<br>"It's
            okay. I am your daddy’s best friend." <br><br> ................................................................................ <br><br> Back to reality<br><br> Whenever I try to enjoy the scenery, I fall asleep on grass very quickly. Maybe
            it's because of my wife, I always used to take a short nap in her lap while she continued to stroll her fingers over my head. Cats and dogs show is about to begin in a few minutes, as I can feel strong winds and there's no one around.
            <br><br>How long have been taking a nap in here. It's almost dark.<br>I can't live with my past anymore. These nostalgia feelings are killing me and are tearing me apart. God somehow show me a way out of this, please! <br><br> Got back in
            my car since I couldn't afford to get sick on my 'Not known where' going trip. <br><br> Starring at a photo frame with a embedded picture of my wife, I muttered - "Now where do you want me to go Shyla?" <br><br> Show me a sign of your next
            move which you planned it a way before my love. I am dying in here without you, I can't hold up these emotions buried deep inside me long enough. Just a little sign of what were you planning to do.<br><br>................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................<br><br>

        <div id="chapter 34">
            Day 3, of my journey to a place not so surely known or ever even dreamed in my crazy life till now....... <br><br> Why am I even doing this? It's causing nothing but disaster. Fuck!!. Maybe it's time to let go everything, and live an ascetic
            life. It's over for me, I can't withhold these painful memories so long. <br><br> Regardless of my wife's hard work to bring me back to normal, there is only two options left for me: Either die or live an ascetic life in the mountains. <br>            Picked up my phone from the bedside table and unlocked it with a swipe. "I am really sorry darling, I guess it's my time too." - I hushed quietly glancing at my wife's pic. <br><br> Every time I look at her the only thing that hits me every
            time is not feeling her arms and her breath around me. An elliptical drop lands perfectly on the digital screen. <br><br> As you already know, I cry like a little boy who lost his favorite toy. But in this scenario, I am weeping for my wife
            who used to treat me like her own child. <br><br> .......................... <br><br> "Beautiful day, isn't it?" - said the waitress.<br>Nothing's beautiful to me at this point of time. <br><br> "So what can I get you to eat or drink, sir?"
            - she said smiling back at me.<br>Maybe I should ask her politely to leave me alone or instead request her to bring me a cup of finely harvested poison. <br><br> "Baffles with a maple syrup and some coffee please."<br>"Ok, anything else which
            I could help you with?"<br>"No, I am fine." <br><br> She turned to place an order for me, but within seconds she turned her head back and started at me. She came back to me with an honest face and said – "Sir, you don't seem alright. Is there
            something wrong with my service or did I hurt you in any way? Or is there something else?" <br><br> Canadians, I love this country but why are they being so nice to every stranger and outsiders. <br><br> "You barely spoke a few words, how
            do you think you can hurt me in any way?"<br>"Ohh! I am sorry sir, is it my language or my way of approach."<br>"Look, there's nothing wrong with you or .... and I am starving can you please get me my order quick."<br>"Yes, it's ready." -
            she said with a friendly smile.
            <br><br>The last best breakfast which I am gonna have I guess. I squeezed some maple syrup on my baffles just like the Canadians do.
            <br><br>Some noxious feelings are making my mind strand by a string. I couldn't think about anything else except my wife's death.
            <br><br>I promised my wife that I would live my life again without her. But I guess I couldn't live just like nothing ever happened in my life. I just couldn't.
            <br><br>I tipped the waitress all the money which I had and left the hotel. ..............................................................................
            <br><br>Just kept driving to find the perfect spot again to leave. I actually found one that too very quick. Maybe my death should be a lesson to all. Why not upload it on YouTube? Let's go fucking live! <br><br> Everything was up and running,
            thanks to the technology though for soothing many of the hectic tasks that a person has to do.
            <br><br>"So what's up people my name is Kumar and I am a fucking nerd. Today, at this fucking time I am gonna tell you my story. A story about a guy who looked like and acted like shit fallen in love with a wonderful girl who departed too
            soon."
            <br><br>Fuck, it's viral within a few minutes. I didn't know that my channel had grown so big.
            <br><br>"Okay, how many of you watching this shit are married. Comment below. You all might be wondering why this hectic jerk is here and broadcasting this online? Well don't worry I am here to take my life while you people keep watching this
            thing. Don't worry this is gonna be quick not a big deal."
            <br><br>"But before I depart this world to get back to my wife, I wanna say you guys something. This is a strong message to everyone who is young and about to get married. See people I loved my wife so much which in tactically made my mind
            and my heart say me to die. See I was addicted to her, she was a powerful drug from other world though." <br><br> "Never love someone more than yourself." - I said and turned back and stepped forward the cliff. <br><br> A nice view to die
            though with no regrets which are gonna be buried in me.
            <br><br>I looked up in the sky and prayed to god - "God, can you promise me one thing. Please take my soul immediately as soon as I fall from this cliff and open up some worm hole to quickly take me back to my loving wife.
            <br><br> Please don't make me pay for my sins by making me hover in this god forsaken world after I die. Please god please."
            <br><br>"Hey guys I just prayed to god to take me back to my wife, after I jump off from this cliff. Can you guys do the same for me. Please everyone pray to god for me. Please guys I am begging you."
            <br><br>.....................................Thud..........................................
            <br><br>

            Well if you are wondering why am I still narrating the story considering the fact, which you guys think I am dead. Then you are wrong. No no I didn't turn into a vicious ghost already. Shit, what am I saying. What I am trying to say is I am not fucking
            dead yet. <br><br> Rewind <br><br>.........................................................................<br><br> While I was about to break the record of jumping from a cliff without adult supervision a citizen of Canada who
            felt the responsible enough to save my life interrupted my new journey at the first place. <br><br> "Hey, you stop right there." - a loud voice from my back yelled at me.<br>"Look, if you are trying to stop this holy ritual. I warn you to
            stay aloof. Please don't interrupt me." - I conveyed my clear message to the person behind me. The voice sounded like a lady to me. <br><br> She/he then smashed my camera set up which took me a couple of hectic seconds to set. I can say that
            she/he smashed my set up by a thud sound which I heard. I didn't care about it anymore though and didn't even bother to look back. <br><br> "Hey, I am telling you to step back or else " - I braked the voice right there by saying - "or else
            what you gonna kill me." After that I didn't hear a thing. I guess the person realized that I am just a waste of space. <br><br> Without wasting any of my last moments, I prayed to god again with a namaste gesticulation showing some respect
            to my hindu culture.
            <br><br>I hovered one of my leg forward in the air and was about to lean towards the open space. But if you still think that I am dead and narrating this story to guys then you are again wrong.
            <br><br>"Hi friend, how are you?" - a voice of a little girl which I heard behind my back. Wait a second, I know who sounds like this. <br><br> I stepped back from the cliff and turned back towards the voice. <br><br> My heart skipped a beat
            for a second. It's the little girl, the daughter of my best friend and it's her mother who felt responsible enough to save me. She smiled looking at me. I almost frost there, I felt numb. <br><br> I walked towards her, to feel the love which
            I kept searching all these years. I picked her up in my arms and she surrounded her arms around my neck. She hugged me really tight.
            <br><br>"What were you doing with one leg up on the edge of a cliff?" - she questioned me with an innocent look. "Nothing, just trying to enjoy the view from a different perspective." - I said.
            <br><br>...................................................
            <br><br>"Honey, why don't you get in the car. It's gonna be a real quick talk with your friend." - the little girls mother insisted. After her daughter got in the car then came a look of Canadian girl angry look which I have never seen before.<br>Then
            came a slap right on my face.
            <br><br>No one ever slapped me till this time, the only exception being my wife. <br><br> I can actually see my vision go a little blur for a few seconds. Then she held my collar and questioned - "Are you a crazy witch? What were you possible
            hoping to get out of doing this crazy thing?"<br>"I was hoping to get back to my wife."<br><br>Then she slapped me again, but this time on the other side of my face. "Don't say it to my on my face." - she said with an eye gouging look at me.
            <br><br> "Get your hands off me. Why are you here? Who told you to pay a visit? You could have showed up after I jumped off the cliff."<br>Then she took a minute to say something which would influence me not to die - "Because I felt responsible
            enough to not let someone die whom I knew very well."<br>"You know me, come on we barely spoke. The only and last time I spoke with you was when Harold was in a hospital."
            <br><br>She then looked at me with an unlighted face. "Sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you. But I don't even know your name and you show up all of a sudden to stop me." - I said.
            <br><br>"Kumar, there's a unfulfilled purpose left by god for you. Find it and finish it. You, me, here at this point of time, maybe there's a purpose for everything. Just because your wife is dead doesn't mean that you need to leave too.
            Please listen to me and promise me that you wont do this crazy thing again!" - she requested me in a meaningful way. <br><br> "I loved her so much, now the only way for me to heal is my death. You don't get it." - I said with a somber face
            and wiping the tears of my face with my palm. <br><br> "Look, we all do love our spouse so much if we are really into them. But that doesn't mean that we gotta die for them too. It's not the way how it works." <br><br> What does she want's
            from me? Why is she so concerned about my well being? <br><br> ..................... <br><br> "So what do you want me to do? To get over this?"<br>"Diversion a lot is needed at this point in your life."<br>"So do you want me to go to my office
            and start working again?"<br>"No, that would worsen things considering what you do and the decisive steps you take to cover your tracks."
            <br><br>She is saying as if she knew me very well.
            <br><br>"What? What are you talking about?" - I questioned her making a straight face.<br>"Let's not talk about it, OK?" - she replied as if she was not interested in making that part of the conversation right now.
            <br><br>"So what do you want me to do?" - I asked.<br>"You know what we are actually looking for a teacher who is good in teaching basic programming to our students." She then paused and then said -"Would you like to take the job?"<br>"How
            come teaching kids gonna heal me?"<br>She then tried to fabricate a good reason to persuade me to take the job. <br><br> "You were after wordily things just like my husband all these years and now suddenly you realize that you are left alone.
            Maybe this job's gonna help you understand life from a different perspective."
            <br><br>Well the reason looks considerable to me. Maybe I should do it. <br><br>

        <div id="chapter 36">
            "Hey! I am sorry to ask you this but, I don't even know your name."<br>"Hmm! My name is April and this is Ellie, my little princess."<br>"Nice to meet you, my name is Kumar."<br>"I know, I saw you many times on the tech news."<br>So she knows
            me well.<br><br> "Hey! I have my car parked in here, do you want me to drive along with you?"<br>"No way in hell. I just made your mind to give life a second chance. Please make yourself in the back or front seat of my car."<br>"What about
            my car?" <br><br> She looked at me in a strange way, like girls do when you ask them questions that might seem irrelevant to them from their perspectives. <br><br> "Oh! That's not a problem I can call a tow truck on the way back home."<br>I
            am gonna stay with her in her house. <br><br> "Wait.. Wait. Do you want me to stay in your home?"<br>"Is it a problem? It's your best friend’s house too right?"<br>Yeah, but the only thing is that he ain't there.<br>"So hop in." - she said.
            <br><br> ....................... <br><br> She was on the wheels while I sat besides the driver seat. I still don't understand why she is doing this for me.<br>
            <br>Ellie fell asleep, and it was almost dawn. I pulled down the window of my seat and felt a sigh of happiness a bit mostly which I didn't felt in year. Everything around me looked like a perfectly painted canvas.
            <br><br>Then I looked at April, she really felt like something to me at that moment. She tacitly had the perspectives of my wife.
            <br><br>I kept staring at her until she uttered - "Is everything alright?" "Yeah, everything's just kept getting better."<br>"That's the energy that I am talking about. And please don't stare at me while I am driving."<br>"Ahh! Okay and sorry
            for staring."<br>"It's okay. No one starred at me for years and I didn't even had a friend to share personal stuff and all." <br><br> Maybe she had gone through phases just like I did too.
            <br><br>She pulled over a coffee shop and asked me -"Do you wanna grab a cup of coffee? It's almost evening right now."<br>Should I tell her that I am not in a mood to drink coffee, instead I am looking for a beer.
            <br><br>"Ahh! ....." - I juggled.<br>"Hmm! You don't seem to be in a mood to drink coffee. Want some beer?" - she questioned with a satisfying smile.<br>"Sure, but do you drink beer?"<br>"Of course, it's common right?"<br>
            <br><br>Well girls drinking beer in our country is not termed as normal.
            <br><br>"OK, I know a good place in here. Let's head there right away." - she said igniting the engine.<br>Should, I ask her to buy me a fine bottle of whisky to ameliorate my situation further more.
            <br><br>She then turned on the car radio.
            <br><br>"Staring at you, I felt a spark in my.... heart. <br><br> You looked like a savior to me.(me,me)
            <br><br>Baby you showed my purpose, thats all that matters right. now.... (oh....)
            <br><br>These little things made me so happy...
            <br><br>How come I didn't knew this, for years......." (That song was really apt to my mood. I was able to synchronize my feelings with it.)
            <br><br> ................
            <br><br>After a couple of minutes she stops by a bar which looked like a cathouse to me. "Hey is this a bar or something else?" - I asked starring at her lips.
            <br><br>"Something else? What is something else to you in here?" - she replied backing off her hair over the ear.<br>Should I admit it? No, let's stay aloof and see what she is up to.
            <br><br>"What about Anna? Is she good in the car?" - I questioned her ubiquitously looking at both of them.<br>"She won’t be up for hours whenever she falls asleep in the car."<br>"Hmm! So we got some time to waste?"<br>"Yeah! Let's go." <br><br>            She ordered some kind of beer which I never even heard of. She shared with me one too. "So tell me a little about your wife?" - She asked me. <br><br> "Like from the beginning?" - I questioned taking a sip of beer.<br>"Now is not the time
            to listen from the beginning. Why not skip a little to suit the quantity left in our bottles?"<br>"Okay, so where do you want me to start from?"<br>"How did you both got married? Did you both got married in an Indian tradition or did it happen
            in a church?"
            <br><br>It's the second abject part of my story to narrate to.
            <br><br>"Well buckle up, it's gonna be short but it's gonna sting a lot."<br>"Try me, I won’t disappoint you."
            <br><br>"Well actually we both got married twice. The other one was legally though." - I aforementioned.
            <br><br>"Twice, never expected that kind of love story from you regarding your career path and etc." - She replied in a ambivalent way placing one of her hands over her check to concentrate more on my narration.<br>"Hey April? Can you promise
            me that you won’t interrupt me in any way possible?" - I said it on her face.<br>"Oh! Okay I promise, go on it's getting late." <br><br>
            <br><br>.........................................here it goes again.............................................................................. <br><br>

        </div>
        <div id="chapter 37">
            Flashback.......................................................................<br><br> It's been like three years for now being my own boss and it's my best friends birthday. It's really hard to see people you love die in front of you, I
            pray to god that this kind of things never happen in my life again.
            <br><br>"God, please I can't live with this kind of acrid or abysmal feelings anymore. Please make sure that this kind of stuff doesn't happen to me again. I am not praying to you god, I am literally begging you to obviate my life from this
            admonish act of yours. Please god, Please!"
            <br><br>Maybe I should show up in my friends house, considering the fact if they remember me at all. Since I have never been there ever since my friend Harold passed away. <br><br> ..........................
            <br><br>I buckled up in my car and was almost set to go. "Tring, Tring ....." - the cell phone buzzes and it's an unknown Indian number. Hmmm! Who might it be? Oh! my parents said me that they are heading back to home, might be a surprise
            from my mom about her new phone. <br><br> "Hello...."
            <br>"Hello sir, is this Kumar D."<br>"Speaking.... And who is one on the other side."<br>"It's the Sub Inspector speaking."<br>"Is there something wrong sir?"
            <br><br>Why would a Sub Inspector of police call me all of a sudden?
            <br><br>"How fast can you get here?"<br>"Get where?"<br>"Your home. And it's really a big concern for you at this time."<br>"Sir? I don't understand what you are trying to convey me. Can you please elaborate a little more of your concern?"<br>"It's
            the toughest part and the most painful part of my job which I hate the most."<br>"Sir, please get to the point."<br>"There has been a major accident where a truck driver hit an SUV. An old couple were in it. And there has been a dearth of
            evidence which we could find after our police enquiry it turns out that the old couple were your parents." <br><br> I just wished to god to forgo these noxious part of life. He failed me again. <br><br> I became inarticulate as soon as I heard
            the word 'Parents'. It was like I was pulled into a black hole, since my vision was blur and it felt like I was trapped in a box. It was like the vibrations from the phone kept reverberating inside the box. I was bluffing -"Ar ar .... aree...
            ...."
            <br>I was babbling unconsciously without a trace of my words to articulate properly. <br><br> "Sir is everything alright?"<br>No, I am loosing my blood pressure very rapidly. I wasn't having the vitality to hold my phone steadily after listening
            to him.<br>"Can you see them, Sir?" Please god make sure that they are alright<br>"Yes, I am with them now."<br>Thank god, he is with them. So they are doing well.
            <br><br>"How are they holding up?"<br>"Sir, it seems that you didn't depict the situation properly which happened last night in here."<br>"What happened? You said you are with them right?"<br>"Sir, I am sorry to say this but your parents suffocated
            to death ever since the accident took place. They were succumbed to death for like 4 hours. There was no one around to call for help nor were your parents in a situation to yell for a savior. It's the most terrible accident case which I have
            ever encountered with in my service." <br><br> That's the time when I started feeling hardcore pain in my nerves, and I was slowly loosing my blood pressure and my conscious<br>.<br>"They left without me......?" - whispering these words and
            sporadically I was all blank........................................ I remember the part where I slipped my phone through my fingers and taking a breath after bashing myself to the ground. <br><br> .................................... <br><br>            "Where am I?" - I questioned with an half open eye lid.<br>"There's nothing to worry about. You are in a hospital." - said the doc.<br>"How long have I been in here?"<br>"It's been like 4 hours since you slipped in here."<br>"Did I get any
            phone calls doc?"<br>"Yeah, a guy who said he was a cop asked me about you."<br>"What did you say?"<br>"I said you were not doing so well and wont be up for 2 days."<br>"Fuck you! My parents encountered a terrible accident last night and they
            passed away after intense suffering for 4 hours. Since there was nobody to call for help and you say that guy who called that I won’t be up for 2 days."
            <br><br>Mom, Dad I am so sorry that I didn't spend enough time with you. Please forgive me Mom, Dad. <br><br> I ripped all those medical inoculations inside me and just kept ambling with my abnormal blood pressure. I was on the loose with
            my health condition, but I can't just give up to see my parents for one last time. <br><br> I wish if anyone gives me a phone.
            <br><br>A Canadian guy quickly approached me and questioned - "You don't seem to be in a condition to be alright. Is everything alright?"<br>"No, I am not. I quickly need to get to airport and fly back to my hometown." - I said back with a
            cry face.<br>"Don't cry, is there something that I can help you with in any way possible?"- he asked me in a polite way as if he was desperate enough to help people.<br>"Can I make a quick call from your phone?"<br>"Sure, why not? Here take
            it." <br><br> I called my COO and requested him to quickly get my luggage to Toronto Pearson International Airport as quickly as possible. And I even requested him to book me a ticket to India or anywhere in India to get there as quick as
            possible. <br><br> After a couple of minutes he said that he wasn't able to book me a ticket at this time.<br>"Listen no matter how much it costs I need to be there as quick as possible, because the only family which I had passed away. So
            please do something about it." - I begged my COO to help me in any way possible. <br><br> The Canadian guy who heard all the conversation which had been going till now gesticulated and said - "If you don't mind to take my help, I work as an
            pilot and I know some private jets that have been in the hanger for a long time. Maybe I could just call some of my flying friends and ask them if they could set us up with anything." <br><br> "Can you do that for me Sir, please do it. It
            would be so generous of you to help a stranger." - I said holding his hands like a adherent follower.
            <br><br>Canadians they are so altruistic to every one in this country. They are having such a magnanimous heart. I wish if people of my country are like this too..
            <br><br>There is an ambiance of good feeling in this country. It's like someone<br>amenably wished upon a shooting star for this country and it's people. Everyone are benevolent towards each other.
            <br><br>This unknown pilot arranged a private jet for me.<br>"I really owe you something, I would be on the ground for you to help. Thanks a lot Sir."<br>"No, you don't owe me anything. You just gotta promise me one thing."<br>"What is it,
            Sir?"
            <br>"In case you feel like someone in this country is upset. Just ask them if you could be of any help for them in any way possible. Promise me." <br><br> This is Canada, it's not the vast diversity of resources. It's the people, they are
            the most valuable resources the world could ever have to restore peace. <br><br> ........................... <br><br> After the security check, I rushed quickly into the jet. I was in such a misery and distress that I even lost the manners
            to ask his name. But while the time when I finally realized this thing, I was up in the air. <br><br> I waved from the window and joined my both hands together gesticulating a 'Namaste' incurring a message of "So grateful of you."
            <br><br>He gesticulated a thumbs up message back to me as a sign of 'You are welcome.'
            <br><br>The only thing that I thought about was my home, and I even imagined it without my parents in it doing the regular stuff.
            <br><br>I began thinking what would be like be at my home without the sound of my mom calling me for dinner, the conventional arguments with my dad about daily stuff, the aroma in the house when my mom's busy preparing my favorite food, the
            funny disputes on the table while my mom trying to calm down the crazy guys in the house, the garden time, the tea time, arguments between my dad over what to plant, the not so funny jokes that my dad makes about politics, and what not experience
            wont I miss from my parents. <br><br>
            <br><br>I was able to clearly visualize all my vivid childhood memories with my parents. <br><br> That cliché saying is true - "You realize the value of a person only when you realize the fact that they are no longer with you. That's when
            we all realize the true value of a person whom you didn't bother to talk to."
            <br><br>Whatever we do with our parents are memories, no matter what kind they are. Even if a person who didn't like his/her parent's are gonna feel like they are left alone when they hear the sad news.
            <br><br>Maybe I should have spent some time with them so that there would be nothing to regret at these hard times. I was crying, literally sobbing and mourning for my dead parents. My eyes turned out red like a zombie. The air hostess understood
            my situation and offered me some tissue and didn't disturb me about anything until the landing took place.
            <br><br>There's no one for me to share my grief with. I don't have a family anymore. I am left alone to starve to death. I had everything that I wanted but not what I needed. I am an orphan now.
            <br><br>

            to talk to me in any manner. Wouldn't you? <br><br> ........................ <br><br> The ritual started as soon as my fathers close friend brought some additional people to surrogate the ritual. His name was 'Sumanth' and he suggested me
            to wear white dhoti and cover my shoulder with a white towel.
            <br><br>"Now, I am a Nobody. There's no one to look after me anymore." - I said while he was offering me the ritual clothes. He remained aloof and didn't say a word. Well at these times, it's better to remain silent. <br><br> I walked into
            my parents room and changed clothes. I could feel my parents in this room, as if they are right there. <br><br> The ambiance in that room reminded me of my childhood days with my parents which made me lost track of my consciousness.......
            <br><br>"Mom, can I sleep with you?" - I requested my mom while she was making bed for me.<br>"Why? Son?" - my mom asked me back.<br>"I am so scared of ghosts."
            <br><br>"Dear, if you keep letting those imaginary ghosts scare you now. Then there would be no place left for you in this world to live. If you run away from a place because of some fears then you would be keep on running relentlessly for
            the rest of your life. Mark my word, never let anyone or anything scare you. Promise me."
            <br><br>"I promise you mom, I promise."
            <br><br>I was interrupted again my Sumanth. "It's getting late, everyone is waiting for you" - he said knocking the door. <br><br> .................. <br><br> The funeral began with me carrying a pot made of clay and some holy water poured
            in it. A white 'vibuthi' was on my forehead and stomach. Sumanth said me to carry this till they bury my parents. <br><br> As soon as those cemetery workers lifted my parents up in the air, the drums sound was lousy. I was stoned.
            <br><br>I thought of aborting this holy ritual for like a day or two and spend the whole time with my parents, by hugging them, preparing them their favorite food, having a chat over the dining table, playing board games ....etc. <br><br>            But that's really not possible as we came half way. I was leading the group who were adherent to this funeral service. <br><br> I didn't even looked back at my parents. Within half hour we were at the grave yard. The Brahman insisted to lay
            the bodies on the ground before burying them. He said me to call my parents like I used to do before. <br><br> I kneeled down and bent forward and said -"Mom, Dad. Dad, sorry that I was not good with you all these days. And mom now I am really
            gonna miss your unconditional love towards me. I love you mom and dad. I love you guys both...." <br><br> Sumant dragged be back and held his arms around my shoulders to let go my grief. I wasn't a cold blooded person. I am human too. I love
            my parents too. <br><br> Now I got nobody to share my happiness with. Those gravediggers did their part and now it's the time for my parents to get in it. When they placed my parents in it, I thought of jumping in it and hugging them for the
            one last time as allusion of final goodbyes. <br><br> I walked straight towards the grave and when I was about to jump in people who noticed me pulled me back.
            <br><br>"No, please let me say my final goodbyes to my parents, please." - I cried.<br>"Please, Please let me in for one last time."<br>After understanding my pain, they let me in to say my final goodbyes.
            <br><br>I hugged them both tighter.
            <br><br>"I love guys, thanks for being with me for all these years."
            <br><br>"I wish to be born as your child the second time. Thanks mom, and Dad you were my hero. I admire you"
            <br><br>"Sorry if I hurt your feelings. Love you the most dad. Bye." - the final goodbyes which made my heart broke. Not just me everyone became pathetic by my actions. Seeing your parents die is the most difficult part of anyone's life.<br>Sumanth
            gave me a hand and pulled me up. The ritual started and the Brahman said me to pour some sand on the pit. <br><br> I wish I had a day with my parents before this. Sorry Mom, Dad. <br><br> After I threw the sand which I held it in my fist,
            the cemetery workers started to spew the sand around the pit. <br><br> "Careful they might get hurt." - I said to one of the fellow workers.<br>Sumanth insisted me to get going, he didn't let me stay until they completely cover the pit. I
            was in a anguish when I saw those people throwing sand over my parents. <br><br> ...... ...... ....... <br><br> Spending the dusk without my parents.
            <br><br>I fell asleep in the couch just like I usually did. My vision was blur and I called out for my mom to get me a cup of tea. No response from my mom.<br><br>"Dad, do you know where mom is?"<br>"Mom, Mom...!" - no response yet then when
            I glanced at the hangings of the wall where my both parents photos were framed decorated with a garland, that's when I came back to my senses and realized that my parents passed away three days ago. <br><br> Maybe it turned out to be that
            I fainted and was not in conscious for the past three days. Tears started to lash out and I started to howl. I smashed my hand to the wall, which didn't break the wall instead broke my fingers. <br><br> "Haa!, haa! .. " - I said in pain as
            my fingers broke. My blood pressure was low eventually since I hadn't eaten anything. But I was able to stand up and walk.
            <br><br>After a couple of minutes a knock at the door.<br>"It's not the time to talk, please come again later." - I said to whomever it was on the other side of the door.
            <br><br>A knock again and again. "Please just leave me alone." - I yelled.
            <br><br>Then I didn't hear any knock sounds.
            <br><br>What should I do now? I am all alone left in here. <br><br>

        </div>
        <div id="chapter 39">
            My sleep was interrupted by an abrupt knock at the door. When I peeped at my watch it was early morning, and the sun dust was on my face as I slept in the middle of the hall way. What these people want from me?<br><br> I was in a intemperate
            anger and rushed towards the door in agonizing pain and opened the door. There was nobody. But something hit my foot. When I glanced down it was a vessel with food in it. <br> I looked around to see who it might be, but couldn't find anyone.
            I wasn't even in the mood to have food so I ignored. <br><br> I have been laying down on the floor for like 4 days for now. And I haven't eaten anything. Splashed some cold water on my face and brushed my teeth. I cross legged and sat under
            the shower for an hour. <br>You know what the best time to cry is during the rainfall or in the bathroom under a shower. Because in either ways you wouldn't even know whether you are actually crying or not. <br><br> After the shower, I was
            a bit normal. And this happens again, a knock at the door. Maybe I should deal with this people my way. I rushed towards the door and when I opened the door something amazing really happened. <br><br> What? Her? Again? <br><br> It was Shyla,
            and she was looking at me miserably. I felt intoxicated when I looked deep into her eyes. It felt something strange to me. There was this insane weird emotion inside me. She then asked - "I came here to offer you some food." <br><br> The only
            person whom I loved before is out there, and the only one ever there in this world whom I could share my grief with. <br><br> No, I can't do that. I left her, I broke her heart ruthlessly. I don't have any right to talk to her. She deserves
            a better person than me. I should forbid her from my life in the first place before anything bad happens again.
            <br><br>"No, thank you!" - I said it on her face.<br>"You are still the same. You didn't change at all."<br>"Thanks for showing some mercy for an orphan. Now please leave my provinces."<br>"I won’t leave until you have this food. Until you
            eat it."<br>"Get lost, I don't need anyone's help or affection towards me."<br>Then I shut the door while she was still out there. <br><br>Sorry Shyla I don't wanna hurt you again by my immature behavior. Please forgive me. <br><br> But she
            was stubborn enough to knock the door again. I ignored until she started to scream out my name. I was scared when she screamed my name for the first time. But still I didn't open the door. <br><br> I better open the door before she does something
            crazy and tell her straight that I wanna live alone forever.
            <br><br>She looked at me with an acrimonious face. She walked straight up to me and gave me a hard slap on my face. "You better eat it right now or else I am gonna punch you hard right on the eye." - she mentioned.<br>"I don't wanna eat."
            - I said.
            <br><br>She then held my collar and stuffed a spoonful of food forcefully into my mouth. I coughed. She then made me drink a glass of water. She reminded me of my mom at that time.
            <br><br>"Please eat it, or else your blood pressure's gonna go low." - she said siting next to me in the couch with a plate in her hand. To my amuse she even knows about my health issue.
            <br><br>She fed me food like mothers do to their little kids. She held her arms around me while I was taking a spoon. I broke again emotionally after seeing her affection towards me. But I remained aloof and decided not to cry in front of
            her. <br><br> "I know why you are doing this?" - she whispered. I acted like I didn't hear a thing. Then after completely feeding me she got up and was about to leave. She turned back towards me while opening the door, as if she was leaving
            a secret message for me. <br><br> I can't do this to her again. <br><br> ......................... <br><br> 12 days exactly for now, ever since I came here. The death ceremony of my parents was 2 days ago and now the ritual was completed partly,
            but the whole ritual lasts for an year in Hindu tradition. It was time for me to go. Maybe I should leave as soon as possible. <br><br> To rewind back my childhood days, I came up in the late night to the terrace. I could still feel like my
            mom yelling my name. When I glanced at Shyla's house, she was up there too. Maybe she comes up in there usually. <br><br> Well this might be my only chance to ask her for an apology, regardless of what I did to her. <br><br> I gesticulated
            my fingers requesting her if I can come over. She gesticulated back a OK. <br><br> When I got in there she was staring at the stars just like I did. She was flagrantly beautiful in that green saree which she wore. Didn't wanna interrupt her
            aesthetic perspective for the night sky. I walked towards her silently and said in a low voice -"The sky looks vivid tonight."<br>Then she said without even looking at me - "It looked more pleasing to me 12 years ago." <br><br> She is definitely
            alluding the sky towards me. Maybe she didn't forget anything like I did. <br><br> Maintaining my distance between us I broke the ice - "Shyla, there is something that I wanted to tell you for a long time." Then she turned her head towards
            me with a miserable look at me and said -"Do you want me to say that it's alright regarding what you did." <br><br> It was hard for me to look in her eyes and apologize. Maybe I should just say it and leave quickly. She is gonna be fine without
            me, she would be more happier if I am not a part of her life. <br><br> "Shyla, please I am not asking for your forgiveness. All I want you to know is that I am really sorry. And thanks for the food. I appreciate it." - I said turning backwards
            from her since I really didn't have the guts to say it looking right in her eyes. <br><br> I apologized what I came here for, now I am gonna leave. Then without looking back I started to step forwards for the stairs to get down from the terrace.
            Even before taking any step further, she grabbed my hand really tight which made me feel so uncomfortable. <br><br> "You just say what you want and leave just like that. You are an asshole, calling you an asshole is a disgrace. You are an
            perverted asshole." - she said assimilating her emotions which were buried deep inside her. Still I didn't look back, when I finally realized that she was crying. <br><br> Maybe I should turn back and apologize in a decent manner to soothe
            her abstruse feelings. <br><br> "I am sorry Shyla, really sorry for what I did." My apologizes still didn't placate her back to normal.<br>"Please don't cry, I am sorry. And yes you are right I am asshole."<br>"Please stop, god please stop
            it right away. See this is the reason why I abhor relations." Then she looked at me trying to say something.<br>"Relations? That's your answer for leaving me?"<br>"Yes. What else did you think?"<br>"You are the one who inserted a wedding ring
            in my fingers. I didn't ask you for that."<br>"I am sorry, I acted out foolishly at that age. You can't mark it as a marriage right?" <br><br> She then pushed me back said - "I made a mistake helping you in the first place. I should have let
            you starved to death in the first place when you were a drug addict." <br><br>
            <br>She was broke down and sobbed like a child. What does she wants from me? <br><br> I kneeled down for her and whispered - "Shyla, we need to move forward in life. You can't just be thinking about what happened 12 years ago. Get over it,
            OK."
            <br>I am responsible for what happened, now I am gonna fix this before I leave again. <br><br> "Shyla, get up now. I order you."<br>"What makes you think I am gonna listen to your words?"<br>"Because I am your ..."<br>"You are what to me?"
            After thinking hard to relate what was she to me at present and after few seconds I said - "You are my friend. My best friend. Right?"<br>"We used to be like best couple. Right?"<br>"Shyla, please I am trying to make things right."<br>"You
            can't fix what you broke, it's intangible. Same applies to me too."<br><br> Without wasting a moment I hugged her real tight. She didn't move a muscle when I wrapped my arms around her nor she denied it in any way. She didn't wrap her arms
            around me until I decided to let go her. She hugged me harder using her full potential. She didn't let me go either after my denial. <br><br> She then whispered - "We are still friends right?"<br>"Yes, Shyla you are my best friend" - after
            me saying these words she hugged even more tighter than before. We spent holding each other far a really long time. I too didn't wanna ruin it. <br><br> ..................... <br><br> "Shyla, it's getting late. I gotta go." - I requested her
            by whispering in her ears. Then she let me a little loose and faced her head in front of me signaling a kiss. No, this is not gonna start over again. I need to end this right away. <br><br> "Shyla, go to bed. Let's hang out tomorrow." - I
            aforementioned. Then she made a disappointed look at me. Then she let me loose completely and I stepped back to maintain the distance. <br><br> "Why not hang out now?"<br>"What? No way?"<br>"Yes way. Please I wanna spend some time with my
            best friend who showed up after 12 years. Please I wanna spend this beautiful time with you. Please..." - she requested no she literally persuaded me to accept her request. Well if this is gonna make her happy and let go her past, then it's
            considerable to spend this lonely time with her. I guess? <br><br> "OK, but one condition."<br>"What?"<br>"Don't let your unconditional feelings ruin our friendship."<br>She thought for a second and said -"OK, you can count on me." <br><br>            ................... <br><br> She cooked my favorite food. And served me well. But one thing kept annoying me, she was constantly staring at me while I was eating. "Please look away, I can't enjoy my favorite food if you keep on staring at
            me like that." - I confessed. <br><br> She cooked it exactly the way my mom used to. How does she know my mom recipe. How? It's like she sneaked our kitchen door while my mom was busy cooking. <br><br> "I know what you are thinking. Don't
            need to think so hard, I asked your mom's recipe." - she said placing her cheek over her folded fist.<br>"Well, thank you! For that."<br>"You deserve it."<br>I guess it's the time to break the silence. <br><br> "Shyla, where’s your husband?"<br>"Well
            I got married when I was 18, and after that he left me and just showed up."<br>"I am serious."<br>"As am I"<br>"Shyla, why are you doing this to yourself. You are pretty and intelligent any guy in this country would accept you as a wife."<br>"I
            have already been accepted by a teenage guy 12 years ago who even risked his life for me." <br><br> She is a stubborn lady. I can't fix her. But let me try one last time. <br><br> "You really wanna be like this for the rest of your life thinking
            of some kind of insane person who can't take responsibilities on his shoulder." - I said it looking at her seriously.<br>"I didn't ask you for that." - she replied.<br><br> "OK, it's your life. Your way. The only reason I left you is, so that
            you could have a better life, a life without a crazy person like me in the picture." - I said. <br><br> She didn't respond but all that I can see is with held emotions that I could see in her eyes. She was about to burst, but she didn't and
            got up from the chair and said - "You are not crazy, stop calling yourself crazy."<br>"Well, I am not so cute as you. Then why would you still want me for god sake in your life." - I questioned. <br><br> "Because I loved you, that's all that
            matters the most. Women don't look for handsome guys, instead they are in a verge for guys like you. Who treat woman like their mom." - she said.<br>"You still don't get it. Anyways thanks for the food, goodbye forever." - then I left her
            house without looking back at her. <br><br> This is not going good, I should have never talked to her in the first place. <br><br> I walked straight towards a tree and kicked it hard with my leg. It was a pain in the ass and then this came
            from my mouth loud enough to awake the entire neighborhood - "Fuck...........!" <br><br>

        </div>
        <div id="chapter 40">
            I kept on wandering in the woods just to assuage my arcane emotions which are emerging out of me. Walking walking.... till I finally reached my parents cemetery. I sat in the middle and articulated my concern for Shyla - "Dad why doesn't she understand
            me? Why is she so stubborn like mom? Why?"<br><br> Then I realized there was someone standing in front of me. When I glanced up, it was my parents. I have the ability to see my parents, I thank god at least for what he has given
            me regardless of what he did. <br><br> "Mom, Dad how are you guys holding up?"<br>"We are feeling desperate, watching you ruin your own life." - my dad said.
            <br><br>"Dear, why are you doing this to yourself? That girl has been waiting for you ever since you left." - my mom said pointing finger at me as it is my fault.<br>"Both of you stop looking at me as if I raped a woman." - I said absolutely.
            <br><br>"My son is not that kind of guy, but you ruined her life emotionally. She had been thinking about you for the past 12 years."<br>"Mom, I had to make that choice. She deserves better life without me being in the picture." <br><br> "You
            don't get to decide what people deserve and what they don't" - my mom augmented the conversation placing her hand over my father's shoulder.<br>"So what you want me to do?" - I raised a question for them.<br>"Be her everything, do whatever
            it takes to make her happy." - my mom arbitrated.
            <br><br>"Son, you don't need to make everyone in this world happy. But never hurt a woman in any way and always make sure that your soul mate gets what she deserves from you." - my dad gave his shrewd thought about marriage.
            <br><br>"Well, we said you what we wanted to. Now, it's time for us to leave. Please make sure that you will make the right choices." - my parents said and vanished in the open air.
            <br><br> ....... .... .....
            <br><br>"Who were you talking to?" - Shyla inquired by placing her hand over my shoulder.<br>"Shit! You almost scared me to death. Cant you be any meaner that this?" - I hushed.<br>"With whom have you been talking to in here?"<br>"Shyla, it's
            none of your business." - I said and started to walk away from her. She then grabbed my hands and questioned again - "Who was that?" <br><br> I should tell her the truth about me. <br>
            <br>"Shyla, there is something that you don't know about me. I can imagine stuff whenever and where ever and how ever I want to."
            <br><br>She was amused when I confessed the truth about me.<br>"Can you imagine me?" - she questioned freeing my hand from hers.<br>"Yes"<br>"For how long have you been living like this? I mean did you imagine me living with you for the past
            12 years?"<br>"Yes.... I did and I still will for the rest of my life."<br>"Now I get it. You are a loner, you don't want anyone in your life except you."<br>"Yes Shyla I am a loner. I am an insane person crazily driven by narcissism."<br>"Now
            I have the perfect reason to forgo your love, wistful feeling towards you." <br><br> Alas! I made things right. <br><br> "Ahh! The best thing that you ever said to me. Goodbye then forever and I wish all the best for your future." -I said
            with a sigh of relief.
            <br><br>"You just wanted me to leave right? Fine, but remember you will regret this for the rest of your life." - she wished a malediction for me. At that point I really broke her heart.
            <br><br>I am making the right choices. Sorry Shyla, I loved you a lot. This is the best for you which I can do. You can hate me for the rest of your life if you want, all I want you is to be happy with someone else. <br><br> Before leaving
            I uttered few words to make this confrontation clear - "Promise me that you will not try to accost me in any manner." She just looked back with watery eyes.
            <br><br>"And make sure that you go home safe, there are lot of insane people wandering in here." - I stated. <br><br> "Why do you even care about me?" - she alleged me for the reason of my concern for her.<br>"Do you want me to walk you back
            home? Please let me do it as a last favor for you which I owe you for your affection towards me."<br>"Go to hell. I don't need your protection. Get lost and never see me again."
            <br><br>"Go safe. OK and Goodbye forever. I wish we would be best friends in other life."
            <br><br>While I was about to take a step she intruded me - "Tell me one reason why you are avoiding me?"<br>"Shyla, I am not avoiding you. I am concerned more about you."<br>"Why? Just tell me why?" <br><br> "Did your father loved you? Of
            course, he did. Tell me one thing, in case your father was alive would he agree to place his daughter in hands of an uncertain person who doesn't even know what marriages are meant for?" <br><br> She didn't interrupt me this time but after
            hearing all my concerns for her she just said one thing loud and clear - "He would have understood my concern towards you."
            <br><br>"Enough Shyla this is over. Now go home safe." Then I looked at her for the one last time. She looked like an celestial being to me at that point.<br>"Shyla, I am a survivor. Bad things keep beleaguering me every time. Bad things keeps
            on begetting in my life. I hope you understand."
            <br><br>We then separated our paths.
            <br><br> ..... .............
            <br><br>Now, this is what I call it as a cool move.
            <br><br>To let out my happiness, I screamed with agonizing feeling of good work - "Fuck....! Fuck .....!" <br><br> This surely might have alerted someone, but who cares anyway. I can live the rest of my life imagining her living with me. <br>
            <br><br>Then a loud scream seized the silence in the woods - "Help! Help! Somebody please help me." Is it Shyla, it's definitely not her, I hope? <br>
            <br>Started to move in the direction of the sound for a couple of seconds but soon I couldn't hear a thing. Oh! God! Please save her. Please don't hurt her this way.
            <br><br>Then I realized that I have been rushing in the wrong direction. It was bewildered, I didn't know what to do to help the only woman who cared more or less for me. "No... Please don't kill me. I am begging you.." - articulated a woman
            with agonizing pain in a low voice. I hope that it's not Shyla.
            <br><br>I looked around cautiously and judiciously without missing anything which could be sight to help that woman. Even though of my comprehensive search, I still couldn't find her. One clue, god please.
            <br><br>To my insights I saw a pig running somewhere. Is it the act of god, to help me find that miserable woman. Is it the path. Hope so?
            <br><br> I trailed that innocent being which I considered as a grace of god. It actually did get me to her. The sole reason being that pig was actually trying to get back to its kids.
            <br><br>By the time I reached the damage was already done. She had been brutally raped and was left to succumbed to agonizing pain for the last few hours. I wasn't able to find her to undo this thing. I had been wandering in the woods for
            the past few hours, I acted foolishly to let her go by her own. I should have trailed behind her.
            <br><br>Her dress had been torn to pieces, she had been lying there crying for help all this time. I rushed towards her and held her hand in mine, she became conscious after that and she arduously opened her eyes.
            <br><br>I covered her body with her ‘saree’, and then I cried - "I told you, it's not safe to stay with me. I tried to protect you from circumstances like this. I failed desperately. I am a nobody."
            <br><br>She was trying to say something and after trying to hard she finally said -"I am sorry. I should have listened to you."<br>"No, I am sorry." - I interrupted her as this was my fault. <br><br> .................... <br><br> I gave her
            my shirt. She was in an extremely sad and servile condition. I didn't wanna say a word about what happened. I picked her up and held her in my arms. She was horrified of what happened to her.
            <br><br>After walking steadfast for a couple of minutes, we reached for the road. We were lucky enough to spot a truck. It was generous of the truck driver to give us a ride to the hospital. <br><br> I made Shyla lie down in my lap, she was
            inarticulate about what just happened to her. I found out that her nails have been ripped and broken and the blood was already dried up. <br><br> That motherfucker beaten her up so viciously and rapped her immorally like an animal. Now Shyla
            is an intense trauma, I don't know if I could ever bring her back to normal.
            <br><br>It's really true about what our parents always say to us - "There are ruthless animals which emerge out in the night in a country like ours, these animals are not frightened by anything. They just get what they want and dissipate in
            the dark and live normally again with us like nothing ever happened. Like they didn't shatter any one’s life." <br><br>

        </div>
        <div id="chapter 41">
            I carried her up in my arms to the hospital. The truck driver was benevolent enough to help us. Shyla was losing conscious and blood.<br><br> "Shyla, don't leave me. I promise to be with you for the rest of your life." - I alleged her with
            a promise. She gave a bewildered smile looking so despondent at me. I need her. I want her in my life. Then the hospital staff quickly rolled a emergency bed. <br><br> "Shyla, look at me. I am not gonna leave without you. I love you, Shyla.
            Remember you are my wife. Avow me that you would be there to grab my hand again." - I cried while we were in the move towards the ICU. <br><br> She whispered in a low voice - "I promise............" The nurse quickly got towards me and told
            me to sign the papers and asked me what was I to her.<br>"She is my wife." - I said.
            <br><br> And I am her husband.
            <br><br> Then she insisted me to quickly get to the chief doctor. I asked her - "Is she gonna be alright?"<br>"We will try our best. Now please go." - the nurse said. <br><br> ................. <br><br> "Had she been raped?" - the doctor asked
            me. <br><br> "Yes"
            <br><br>"Sir, I suggest you to file a complaint in the police station."<br>I glanced at him with a bereaved look in his eyes. Police, what they are gonna do about it, other than question the victims with a slandering belittle look.<br>"Why?"
            - I asked him.<br>"These kind of things need to be notified to the police." - he said back.
            <br><br>Rules, Government. How effective are they in our country. What's the use if the accused get banished after decades after the incident took place.
            <br><br>"What if I do not do it? Are you gonna say them to stop the surgery?"<br>"No! Why would I do that? But it's a formal procedure in our hospital where we request our patients to file a FIR. It's mandatory though, or else we could make
            the cops come in here and take evidence from the victim. If you reject it, we are gonna abort the surgery right away."
            <br><br>"What if I say no?"<br>"You can't do that, these are rules."<br>"You know what, I would make you suck my dick if you say a word involving cops, rules ...."<br>"What did you just say?" <br><br> "I told you to suck my dick asshole."
            - yelling my anger out, I then punched that dickhead on the face. He was slammed right on to his table. He then got up and stared at me with an awry look.<br>"What did I say? I just told you to caution the cops." - he articulated with a low
            voice feeling the pain in his cheeks.<br>"Fuck these rules. I don't give a shit about your motherfucking rules. OK, and if you say a word out there I would do whatever it takes me to fuck that hole in your face."<br>"OK, I won’t. Is she your
            wife?"
            <br>"No, not legally. But I am gonna take her with me to a place where I found myself. A country which made me realize what my true purpose is."<br>"Where?" <br><br> "Canada. And I am a citizen of Canada, and my wife is too. I wanna take her
            there and make her happy." <br><br> "You don't wanna do anything about that person who brutally raped your girl? Don't you wanna make him suffer in jail?"<br>"What good is it gonna be anyways? You know what this shit is useless. These kind
            of people rape, they live happily in jail for years they come back again sacrifice another woman or women's. And then the same happens." <br><br> These kind of people should be executed publicly, instead of feeding them and giving them all
            the amenities that a person needs. <br><br> The doctor didn't say a word fearing if I would punch him again. While I was about to leave he queried me about Shyla asking - "What are you gonna say to her? Are you gonna tell her that you left
            that animal freely without doing a thing about it?" <br><br> "Tell me one thing doctor? Is killing that person or pressing charges against him gonna make her feel better? <br>She is just gonna be bereaved whenever she confronts a situation
            about it again in her life. It's just gonna deprave her mental health and if things don't go well, she would sacrifice herself. <br> Do you want that kind of stuff to happen to my girl?" <br><br> I turned towards him one more time and stated
            - "She wouldn't be happy even if I kill that ruthless animal. She doesn't want me to be a some kind of hero, but she always wants me to be a man. A generous person, that's what she wants. And I am willing to be that kind of person." <br>
            <br>"I am sorry for being so immoral. And I wish you good luck. Take care of her, she deserves it." - the doctor said it heart fully. <br>
            <br> ............... <br><br> I have been in the hospital waiting outside deliberately to see her again, to hear good news from the nurse, to hear her say that she is gonna be fine. She promised me that she would make it through. I believe
            in her. I love you Shyla, please come back. Please Shyla, I am begging you.... <br><br> Hours passed, still I didn't hear anything from that person whom I have been expecting to carry good news. Kept on staring at the walls. You know what
            I felt like these fucking walls might be communicating with each other.
            <br><br>And these sign boards felt so annoying to me, regarding the situation what I was currently facing. Fuck these walls. And fuck these sign boards too.
            <br><br>"Fuck you all!" - I screamed. <br><br>

        <div id="chapter 42">
            "Yes, I ignored her for her well being before. But now I realize what mistake I have committed in my life. She loved me more than I did. She treated me like her own son. She was really special to me." - I expressed my affection towards Shyla.<br><br>            "I can see that, man. I wish you both a good life. May god be with you." - as soon as he said that, my phone buzzed. It was a call from the hospital, and I was apprehensive of what might have happened.
            <br><br>"Hello.."<br>"Kumar, you need to come right away."<br>"What is it? Is she okay?"<br>"I just can’t tell you that. Just come over here sir, quickly." <br><br> .............. <br><br> I drank a lot, and it made my body so intoxicated
            which made me resentment even to stand up walk.
            <br><br>There's a part of my life which is trying to keep up the promise, I need to rush.
            <br><br>Somehow I reached the hospital and ran with bewilderness, hoping to hear good things. When I was about a few steps away from the emergency ward, I could see nurses and a doctor who seemed like they were waiting for me to convey an
            important message. <br><br>I finally reached the emergency door and the nurse interrupted me - "Sir, the doctor needs to talk to you about her." <br><br> "Please let me see her. Not now."<br>"We can't let you do that, I hope you understand."<br>"What
            happened to her?"<br>"Sir calm down.." <br><br> "No, I am not gonna calm down.." - I said and breached the emergency ward and screamed Shyla's name. The staff was after me though, but who cares.
            <br><br>I looked everywhere, but all my efforts were abortive. I wasn't able to find her. I observed that there was a curtain which had been kept closed. I walked breathing heavily, not knowing what to expect.
            <br><br>Please Shyla, please .....
            <br><br>When I pushed the curtains to one side I saw her lying in the bed looking at me. She said - "What took you so long to get back to me?"<br>I broke into tears when I saw a smile in her face again. <br><br>Thank god, Thanks a lot.
            <br><br>"I love you Shyla." - I cried kneeling down on the ground while she was up glancing down at me.<br>"What happened to you, are you showing mercy at me?"<br>
            <br>"Shyla, think it whatever you want. I don't care about what you think or what this fucked up society thinks about us. All I wish is you to be with me forever." <br><br> She didn't know what to say so I eased up the confusion which she
            was beleaguered with and said - "I wanna take you back with me to Canada, as my wife legally."<br>"What if I say no?" <br><br> Does she really mean it? Did I really broke her heart more than anyone else?
            <br><br>"I love you, Shyla. And I wanna treat you like my princess for the rest of my life, if you give me a chance. Please understand me. I can't live without you, and I regret that it took me 12 fucking years to realize what I have been
            missing." <br>
            <br>"Kumar, I love you too. But it's too late, I have been raped. Now this society points fingers at me."<br>"Shyla, I doesn't matter to me anymore. Fuck this society, they are perverted assholes who are so immature to understand what it's
            really like to be in someone's else's shoes. I love you Shyla, and I still will be for the rest of my life even if you don't." <br><br> Then she burst into tears after hearing my perspectives about her and said - "I love you Kumar, I love
            you."
            <br>"I love you too Shyla, and I am gonna take you far far away from this shit hole. We don't have to look back again in our lives. I am taking you with me."<br>Then she touched my fingers and expressed herself so emotionally to me. <br><br>            She made it through, and now it' time for me to make a promise to her. <br><br> I grabbed her hands in mine and said in a low voice - "Shyla, I promise you that I would be there for the rest of your life. I would treat you like my mom, and
            I would look after you like she used to take care of me when I was a child." <br><br> Taking a deep breath and paused myself a bit to get the best out of me - "You don't have to do any of the household stuff, I can do it all by myself. At
            the end of the day all I wish for is to see you being happy living with me. Baby, just say yes." <br><br> Then again I took a deep breath and asked desperately - "Baby, if you want me then just hold my hand real tight. If you want me to leave
            then pull your hand back. I would make sure that I would never show up here in this country again."
            <br><br>I should have never drank too much, where the alcohol knocked me down even before seeing what she choose to.
            <br><br> .............. <br><br>

        </div>
        <div id="chapter 43">
            Did she leave me...?<br><br> I really feel like I am being left behind to suffer. Now, Shyla is not there anymore regarding what I did to her. Then I started to cry with no one there to hug and mourn for myself anymore.
            <br><br>I hate myself.. I shouldn't never have done that kind of thing to her. I should feel pity for myself right now.
            <br><br>I woke up with a headache and when I looked around it was late night. There was no one around to answer my queries.
            <br><br>Did Shyla decided to leave? I should have never left her in the first place.
            <br><br>Thinking about Shyla made me shed tears diligently.
            <br><br>"Why are you crying?" - said Shyla sitting besides my hospital bed which I wasn't aware of.<br>"I thought you left me?"<br>"Why would I do that?"<br>"Because I betrayed your love once."<br>"You never betrayed me. You cared about me
            more than I did or anyone else did."
            <br><br>"Thanks for understanding me, Shyla."<br>"There's no need to thank your own friend." - she said grinning like a little child.<br>Now she decided to be my friend.. <br><br> "So Shyla, how is it going?" <br><br> But I can still see the
            scars in her face. <br><br> "What do you want me to say, Kumar? Do you want me to say that I am fine after all this?" - she alleged me with disparate look at me.<br>"Shyla, I didn't mean that way." - I articulated.<br>"Well ...." - I intruded
            her and requested - "Shyla, let's go outside for a while and talk. There are things that I wanna talk with you in a soothing milieu."
            <br><br>"Kumar? It's over. Now you can go on with your life. Please don't worry about me, promise me that." - she begged.<br>Then I got up with a lot of effort and pulled out all the medical inoculations<br>fiercely and stood in front of her
            and said - "Baby, I am mandating you right now to come with me. Let's talk outside."
            <br><br>But she stayed aloof and didn't say a word for a second and then said - "Kumar, you shouldn't be doing this."<br>Then I picked her up in my arms and walked out of the hospital steadfast without looking at her or without any concern
            about what people might think.
            <br><br> ..................................
            <br><br>We sat on a bench by the hill, which looked desperate enough for me to sit and mollify Shyla's grief. The view was vivid with flagrant stars and the moon to lit up light for the darkness. <br><br>I sat very close to her and held her
            arms in mine and said - "Shyla, I have been a very insane person."<br>"No, Kumar. You are not?"<br>"Shyla, admit that I am a bad person." <br><br> Then a long silence and our eyes met, I could see silver glitters in her eyes. We just kept
            looking at each other for a long time.
            <br><br>"Kumar, I don't deserve you. That's all that matter the most now."<br>"You don't get to decide that, Shyla. You don't decide what people deserves and what they don't."
            <br><br>"Kumar, the reports were out the other day and the doctors said that I would never be a mother in my life again." - she cried.
            <br><br>I guess every woman's end game is definitely to be a mother. That's how I guess they transgress their higher power.
            <br><br>"I always imagined to have a daughter in our sweet relationship. You know what I even named her 'Alex'."<br>"Shyla, we can always have kids in our relationship. We can be each other's kids for the rest of our life. I would never regret
            it, Shyla."
            <br><br>Then she looked flagrantly desperate and laid her head on my shoulder and said - "Kumar, it's easy to say this now. But families doesn't work that way." <br><br> "Can you stop this family shit for a second?"<br>"See, you are already
            abhorring it."<br>"Shyla, I don't know how this families work but I know how to make this thing between us work right away."<br>"What do you mean?"<br>"Shyla, I want you to come with me to Canada legally as my wife." <br><br> Then she looked
            bemused for a while and said sporadically - "Really? After all this you still want me to be a part of your life?"<br>"Shyla, I need to tell you something."<br>"Like what? You love me kind of thing?"<br>"Yes, it is. I want you to be a part
            of my life. Please I am begging you not to leave me alone."
            <br><br>What goes around, comes around. It's true.
            <br><br>"Now you begging me? Really? I am damaged and I can never live with this guilt feeling ever again."<br>"Shyla, you are not guilty. The person who did this to you is out there living happily like he didn't did anything at all. But the
            only person whom I loved the most is pleading guilty, the only reason she being the victim."
            <br><br>"Kumar, just stop it and leave me alone. Get out of here right now." I need to do something crazy to get into her head. <br><br> "So you are not gonna come with me?" - I questioned her dubiously.<br>"Yes, and please get the hell out
            of here." - she replied.
            <br><br>I stood up and walked straight towards a dustbin. I opened it and searched for sharp objects. The dustbin contained all the used medical stuff. Luckily I found an sealed surgical blade. I opened it and pointed the sharp edge near to
            my superficial nerve in my left hand.
            <br><br>"Shyla...!" - I screamed.<br>"No....!" - she yelled and came running towards me.<br>"I will cut it loose, if you take any step further..." - I stated while she was three steps away from me.<br>"Kumar, you can't be doing this."<br>"You
            made your decision to not come with me. So here I am making the right choices in my life. After all I am an orphan now."
            <br><br>"Kumar, Please don't do this." - she cried.<br>"No Shyla it's too late to ask. Good Bye! See you in other life, if I ever get a chance." - I articulated my anguish and cut my vein vertically. Shyla spontaneously held her hands tightly
            around my arm to stop the blood flow.
            <br><br>"Nurse! .... Nurse .....!" - She screamed. After that she flipped her decision about being my wife and pitched in.
            <br><br>I can still see her passionate feelings for me in her eyes. But she is stubborn and doesn't want me to be in her life anymore. But I love her, and I need her more than anyone.
            <br><br>We got married in my Hindu tradition, that's when I found her so meticulously beautiful with jewelries which she wore. She looked like a Hindu goddess to me at that time when she was walking straight towards me to accept a three knots
            of sacred thread named 'thalli' which would be tied loose around her neck.
            <br><br>She was a really wonderful woman. And I made the right choice at that point. My life entangled into a marvelous one, after choosing Shyla as my wife. I never regretted it, ever.
            <br><br>I loved her and she loved me back more diligently. If someone asks me what an ideal soul mate looks like, I would deliberately point my finger at her.
            <br><br>

        <div id="chapter 44">
            Present evening with April..... In the bar....<br><br> "So what do you think?" - I asked her. She didn't say a word about our story, but sooner I saw her eyes dripped with tears, when I tapped her shoulder with my hand. She was dismayed and
            was still in some kind of trauma after hearing my story. <br><br> “I envy your love for her, I am totally sad and servile right now. I don’t even know why?” – she cried.
            <br><br>"I didn't even know that you were so kind towards your wife. You cared for her more than you did for yourself. That's something which I haven't seen in any couples." - she articulated after recovering from my shock.
            <br><br>"You really think I loved her so much?" - I asked her.
            <br><br>"Don't you think so? You were her everything. You were her lucky star. I guess she wished upon a star and it showed flagrant sign on you. I guess she loved you more than anyone else could have ever done." - she said back. <br><br>            "Yes, I guess. That's what's make me intactically feel like I couldn't live without her." - I stated.<br>
            <br>"She wanted you to live happily that's why she made many efforts before she realized that it was her time." <br><br> What is she saying? She sound like as if she knew her.
            <br><br>"Do you know my wife?"<br>"Yes, she called me one day and requested me to meet her."<br>"Did you guys meet each other?"<br>"Yes, I did. She was amazingly beautiful and so kind towards me."<br>"What did she say?"<br>"She told me about
            her cancer, and confessed that it's her last days."<br>"What did she say? Did she say anything about me?"
            <br><br>"It was really hard for me to tell you this. But, your wife insisted me to look after you when she would not be in a situation to be there with you anymore."<br>"She requested you to look after me, that's the reason why you showed
            up before actually committing suicide?"<br>
            <br>"Yes, she cried to look after you. She was prescient enough that you would be doing this kind of crazy stuff."
            <br><br>"So she has been planning this whole thing before."<br>"Yes, indeed."<br>"Then why come she didn't tell me about her?"<br>"What could you have done, possibly?"<br>"I could have taken to any part of the world to find a cure for her
            illness. I could have done something."<br>"Actually there is nothing you could have done to help her." <br>
            <br>There is nothing I could have done to help my wife? "Really, nothing? That's what you are gonna say?" - I cried.<br>"Face the truth, her illness was incurable."<br>"But I could have at least spent the last few days with her. I could have
            fulfilled her wishes, dreams ... something to make her happy." <br><br> "You know what, it was you. Her last wish was you. She didn't wanted anything more than you. Being your wife was the biggest wish for her. You were her lucky charm..."<br>"I
            guess so." <br><br> .............. <br><br> "Okay, it's time. Let's go home, now." - she stood up and said.<br>"Yeah, let's go. I hope this tutoring thing alleviates my pain." - I articulated.<br>"Well, let's find out." - she verbalized with
            a smile like a adorable cute girl. <br><br> When I stood up, something slipped from my pocket. It was a box, which I didn't recognized at the first place. <br><br> April looked back and picked it up from the ground and said - "What is it?"<br>She
            then immediately opened the box and looked a little astonished to me.
            <br><br>"What's in it?" - I questioned her. But she didn't answer. When I walked towards her and looked it was a pair of weeding rings which Shyla saved for me.
            <br><br>Why did she do this? What's the reason behind Shyla's meticulous plan for hiding these weeding rings from me?
            <br><br>She then looked pleasant, with a chasm of enchanted spell which was too hard for me to ignore. Maybe she is expecting something from me?
            <br><br>"Is this yours, Kumar?" - she asked desperately.<br>"Yes, it's mine. But it was given to me from my wife by her secret messenger."
            <br><br>April was really hoping something out of this.
            <br><br>"Kumar, can I say you something?"<br>"Yes, what is it?"
            <br><br>"After hearing your story, I became so pathetic and totally wretched." - she stated.<br>"April, what is it?"
            <br>"Kumar, I don't know if I can tell you this. But the truth is I am totally into you. Would you give me a chance to be a part of your life?" - she begged. What is she talking about, we just met. Not just met, I knew her well. But why is
            she acting so weird.. <br><br> "April? What are you talking about? We barely knew each other, this is the first time we are having a friendly conversation. Right?" - I alleged her.
            <br><br>"I have been stalking you ever since your wife passed away." - she obfuscated the conversation still. <br> "Are you totally fucking kidding me? You have been around me the all time? That's how you made it to the cliff?" - I asked her
            abstrusely. <br><br> "Yes, I was. Do you know why?" - she questioned with a abysmal look at me.<br>"Why?" - I asked.<br>"Because your wife told me so." - she confessed finally. "April, I am really so grateful to you for saving my life and
            showing me a purpose. But I don't deserve you. You are the most sensible and passionate person that any guy would love to be with."- I articulated hardly. <br><br> "Stop it? Just stop it."- she yelled. <br><br> "Just say yes. That's all I
            what to hear.." - she stated. <br>
            <br>The last time when I rejected my wife’s proposal, it ended up she being a victim. I don’t want it to happen again to any other woman because of the choices I make. Sometimes we must let destiny happen, as it is meant to be.
            <br>I can still feel her body odor around me. I feel like crying right now.
            <br><br> This is totally happening, Shyla wanted me to forgo my past and really wanted me to live again. She cared for me even after she realized that she is no longer gonna stay with me. It's true, she was my secret savior. <br><br> I love
            you Shyla... <br><br> Thanks for being a part of my life. Thank you for everything Shyla. <br><br> ………………………………………..
            <br><br>“Sometimes it might be hard to go through phases in our life, but when you feel a strong armor around you to protect from bad things. That’s when you actually found yourself”. <br><br> Thanks for reading my novel…<br><br> Dheshoju
