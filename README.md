An Online Marketing Platform based project build to market my very own novel 'Love is Patient, it's Kind'.

Built upon the idea of referral code based system, where anyone who signs up in the website gets a unique referral code. 
The generated referral code can be used by the users to share it with others and persuade them to use it in the app.

Created an app to increase the profits generated by ads. Designed a sleek user interface in the android app to soothe the book 
reading experience for the readers.

Everyone who used their referral code with others can check their revenue in their profits section.

Used Google Admob library in the android app to update the server with concerned data.

Fixed the bugs on time to time. 

<b>Worked with a team of 6 members including me.</b>
<ul>
<li>Lekhan Guru Sai (Team Manager)</li>
  <ol>  
    <li>Managed to mollify the disputes among his team members, saved me to complete the work on time.</li>
    
    <li>Added fuel to the team spirit and persuaded everyone in his team to submit the given task before deadline.</li>
  </ol>
 

</ul>
